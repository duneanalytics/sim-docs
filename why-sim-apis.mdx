## Truly Real-Time

In the world of onchain applications, speed is a necessity.
Your users expect instant updates, and real-time agents demand the freshest data.
sim APIs are engineered for market-leading performance, delivering data **\<100ms from block propagation**.

This means your app can react to onchain events almost as they happen.
Whether you're updating wallet balances, displaying live transaction feeds, or powering sophisticated DeFi analytics, sim APIs gives you the most current state of the blockchain.

## Unified Multichain Access

Your development process doesn't have to be a tangled mess of separate APIs and inconsistent data formats.
sim APIs offer a **single, unified API to over 60 chains**, including EVM & SVM networks.

This reduces development overhead, speeds up time-to-market for new features, and simplifies maintance. 
Get production-grade, normalized data from a single, reliable source.

## Deep, Actionable Insights

Our APIs provide deep metadata coverage and derived activity feeds (like swaps, transfers, and approvals) that save you countless hours of data processing.
Dune's proprietary **onchain pricing engine fetches real-time prices directly from liquidity pools** at query time to give you accurate asset valuations.
This lets you easily:

- Display accurate portfolio values
- Understand complex transactions at a glance
- Implement advanced features like liquidity-aware spam filtering

## Built for Production Scale & Reliability

When your app takes off, you need an infrastructure partner that can scale with you.
sim APIs can handle massive request volumes.

For example, Warpcast processes over 20 million requests per month via sim APIs for their native wallet and maintains exceptional uptime and performance.
Layer3 relies on our speed and scalability to verify user actions across numerous chains for their Quest platform.

## Developer-First & Transparent

Developers need tools that are easy to work with.
sim APIs are designed with a developer-first mentality:

*   **Easy Integration:** Get up and running quickly. Layer3, for instance, completed their migration in just 48 hours.
*   **Clear Docs:** Comprehensive API references, guides, and examples available on our docs and GitHub.
*   **Transparent Pricing:** We offer straightforward, per-request pricing with generous free tiers and enterprise plans tailored to your needs. No opaque credit systems or surprise bills – just predictable costs as you scale.

## You're in good company

Leading Web3 companies trust sim APIs to power their infrastructure.

**Warpcast** integrated sim APIs to power their native wallet's Tokens tab after facing instability with previous providers.
They achieved unified data access across Ethereum, Base, and other chains, with real-time responsiveness under 100ms from block propagation, and **scaled to handle over 20 million monthly requests with 100% uptime**.

> "Dune isn't just an API vendor—they're a strategic partner. Their roadmap aligns with our mission to make Warpcast the most user-friendly wallet in crypto." - **Dan Romero**, **Founder of Warpcast**

**Layer3**'s Quest platform replaced dozens of separate APIs with sim APIs, reducing their Solana query times from 30 seconds to under 500ms, a 50X improvement.
They simplified backend operations with a single unified API call, gained comprehensive data access, and completed the entire integration **in just 48 hours**.

> "We replaced hundreds of requests with a single request to sim APIs. It's fast, reliable, and lets me focus on building." – **Lars Karbo**, **Engineering at Layer3**
