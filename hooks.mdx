Streamline your React development with official Sim API Hooks.
This library offers a `SimProvider` for straightforward API key management and custom React hooks.
`useTokenBalances` and `useTransactions` can fetch and display onchain data like token balances and paginated transaction histories in your app.

For comprehensive documentation, including installation, setup guides, and detailed examples for each hook, please refer to the official GitHub repository:
