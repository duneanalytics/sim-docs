title: 'React Hooks'
---

We've created an easy to use hooks package for React apps that you can use to plug in your applications.

Currently, only EVM APIs are supported in the hooks package, but we will eventually enable all APIs.

1. [Token Balances](./evm/balances): Access accurate and fast real time balances of native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on EVM blockchains.
2. [Transactions](./evm/transactions): Access transactions for accounts in real time across EVM blockchains.
