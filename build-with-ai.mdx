We provide several resources to help you use LLMs and AI coding assistants to build much faster with sim APIs.

## AI Search

First, **AI search** is built directly into this documentation site.
The search bar, powered by Mintlify, can understand natural language queries.
Ask questions about endpoints, authentication, or specific data points, and it will answer you with the most relevant, accurate information.

## Use with LLMs

Next, you can access content in various LLM friendly formats.
Every page on this documentation site offers several quick actions:

- **Copy Page:** Copies the fully rendered content of the current page.
- **View Markdown:** Provides a URL with the raw Markdown source. This is ideal for direct input into LLMs.
- **Open with ChatGPT:** Instantly loads the page's content into a new session with ChatGPT. Ask questions, summarize, or generate code based on the page's content.

You can retrieve the Markdown version of any documentation page by appending `.md` to its URL. For example, `/evm/activity` becomes [`https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/activity.md`](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/activity.md).

You can also type `⌘C` or `Ctrl+C` to copy any page's Markdown content.
Try it now.

## Cursor Integration

To integrate our docs directly into Cursor:

1.  Go to Cursor Settings -> Features -> Docs -> Add new doc.
2.  Provide a name (e.g., "simAPIs").
3.  For the URL, you can use the link to our `llms-full.txt` file which contains our entire documentation optimized for LLM consumption. You can find it at [`https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt`](https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt).
4.  Once configured, you can reference sim APIs documentation by typing `@simAPIs` (or the name you chose) in your Cursor chat window.

Open [`llms-full.txt`](https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt)

If you prefer a more compact format, use our OpenAPI spec.
It details all available endpoints, parameters, request bodies, and response schemas that LLMs and AI code generation tools can use to understand our API structure.

Open [`openapi.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duneanalytics/sim-docs/refs/heads/main/openapi.json).
