We provide several resources to help you use LLMs and AI coding assistants to build much faster with sim APIs.

## AI Search

First, **AI search** is built directly into this documentation site.
The search bar, powered by Mintlify, can understand natural language queries.
Ask questions about endpoints, authentication, or specific data points, and it will answer you with the most relevant, accurate information.

## LLM-friendly Content Access

Next, you can access content in various LLM-friendly formats.
Every page on this documentation site offers several quick actions:

- **Open with ChatGPT:** Instantly loads the page's content into a new session with ChatGPT. Ask questions, summarize, or generate code based on the page's content.
- **View Markdown:** Provides a URL with the raw Markdown source. This is ideal for direct input into LLMs.
- **Copy Page:** Copies the fully rendered content of the current page.

</Frame>

You can retrieve the Markdown version of any documentation page by appending `.md` to its URL. For example, `/evm/activity` becomes `https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/activity.md`.

You can also type `⌘C` or `Ctrl+C` to copy any page's Markdown content.

## Cursor Integration

For developers using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), an AI-enabled IDE, we provide a `.cursorrules` file.
This will help the LLM produce consistent, readable API code regardless of the language or frameworks you're using.
You can find it at [`https://sim.dune.com/cursorrules`](https://sim.dune.com/cursorrules).

<PreviewButton href="https://sim.dune.com/cursorrules">Open .cursorrules for sim APIs</PreviewButton>

You can also integrate our docs directly into Cursor.
To add sim APIs docs as a knowledge source in Cursor, do the following:

1.  Go to Cursor Settings -> Features -> Docs -> Add new doc.
2.  Provide a name (e.g., "simAPIs").
3.  For the URL, you can use the link to our `LLMs-full.txt` file which contains our entire documentation optimized for LLM consumption. You can find it at `[https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt](https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt)`.
4.  Once configured, you can reference sim APIs documentation by typing `@simAPIs` (or the name you chose) in your Cursor chat window.

You can significantly streamline your development workflow in Cursor with these resources.

## OpenAPI Specification

For a comprehensive, machine-readable definition of sim APIs, we provide an `openapi.json` specification.
This file details all available endpoints, parameters, request bodies, and response schemas.

You can download or link directly to our OpenAPI specs at [`https://docs.sim.dune.com/openapi.json`](https://docs.sim.dune.com/openapi.json)
LLMs and AI code generation tools can parse this file to:

- Understand data structures and relationships.
- Assist in constructing valid API requests.
- Help debug issues by understanding expected inputs and outputs.
