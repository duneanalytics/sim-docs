We provide several resources to help you use LLMs and AI coding assistants to build much faster with Sim APIs.

## AI Search

First, **AI Search** is built directly into this documentation site.
The search bar, powered by Mintlify, can understand natural language queries.
Ask questions about endpoints, authentication, or specific data points, and it will answer you with the most relevant, accurate information.

## Use with LLMs

### Complete Documentation for LLMs

For LLM applications such as custom agents, RAG systems, or any scenario requiring our complete documentation, we provide an optimized text file at [`https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt`](https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt).

### Per-Page Access

Each page on this documentation site offers several ways to access its content in LLM-friendly formats:

- **Copy Page:** Copies the fully rendered content of the current page.
- **View Markdown:** Provides a URL with the raw Markdown source. This is ideal for direct input into LLMs.
- **Open with ChatGPT:** Instantly loads the page's content into a new session with ChatGPT. Ask questions, summarize, or generate code based on the page's content.

</Frame>

You can retrieve the Markdown version of any documentation page by appending `.md` to its URL. For example, `/evm/activity` becomes [`https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/activity.md`](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/activity.md).

You can also type `⌘C` or `Ctrl+C` to copy any page's Markdown content.
Try it now.

## Add Docs to Cursor

To integrate our documentation directly into Cursor:

1. Go to Cursor Settings -> Indexing & Docs -> Add Add.
2. Enter "docs.sim.dune.com" in the URL field.
3. Provide a name (e.g., "@simdocs").
4. Hit confirm. The documentation will sync automatically.
5. Reference Sim APIs documentation by typing `@simdocs` (or your chosen name) in your Cursor chat window.

## Cursor Rules for Sim IDX

To speed up your [Sim IDX](/idx) development, you can use our Cursor Rules.
By defining rules, you can teach the AI about Sim IDX's specific architecture, coding patterns, and project structure.
This makes sure that any generated code, from Solidity listeners to TypeScript APIs, is consistent and adheres to best practices, saving you a lot of time with revisions.

To set up a project rule for Sim IDX:

1. Go to Cursor Settings -> Rules & Memories -> Project Rules -> Add Rule
2. Name the file (e.g., `sim-idx-patterns.mdc`) and confirm. This will create the file in your project's `.cursor/rules` directory.
3. Copy and paste the following content into the new rule file:

````markdown sim-idx-patterns.mdc [expandable]

# Sim Idx Project Rules

Read the docs from here https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt

## Framework Overview
- Sim idx is Dune's blockchain event indexing framework
- Projects have two main components: Solidity listeners and TypeScript APIs  
- Listeners hook into blockchain events, APIs serve indexed data

## Project Structure
- `listeners/` - Solidity contracts for event listening
- `apis/` - TypeScript APIs using Hono + Drizzle
- `abis/` - Contract ABI files for code generation
- `sim.toml` - Project configuration

## Solidity Listener Patterns

### Contract Structure
- Main contract extends `BaseTriggers` with `triggers()` function
- Listener contracts implement generated event interfaces (e.g., `mUSDC$OnMintEvent`)
- Always import: `import "sim-idx-sol/Simidx.sol";` and `import "sim-idx-generated/Generated.sol";`

### Event Handling
- Event handlers receive `EventContext` and typed params struct
- Use `EventContext` to access transaction/block data: `ctx.txn.hash()`, `ctx.txn.chainId`
- When you are handling an event, the events params are in generated structs: `inputs.minter`, `inputs.mintAmount`
- Emit custom events or call external functions in handlers

### Trigger Registration
```solidity
// Register event triggers
addTrigger(
    ChainIdContract(chainId, contractAddress),
    listener.triggerOnEventName()
);

// Register function triggers  
addTrigger(
    ChainIdContract(chainId, contractAddress),
    listener.triggerOnFunctionName()
);
```

### Context Usage
- `ctx.txn.hash()` - transaction hash
- `ctx.txn.chainId` - chain ID
- `ctx.txn.call.caller` - transaction sender
- `ctx.txn.call.callee` - contract being called
- `block.number`, `block.timestamp` - block data

### Development Workflow
- Generated code is in `lib/sim-idx-generated/`  
- Never edit generated files directly
- Test listeners with Foundry: `forge test`

## OpenAPI Specifications

For a more compact format, we provide OpenAPI specifications for each of our endpoints. These files detail available parameters, request bodies, and response schemas. This format is particularly useful for LLMs and AI code generation tools to understand our API structure.

You can find our OpenAPI specifications in the following directories:
- EVM API specifications: [`/evm/openapi/`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/sim-docs/tree/main/evm/openapi)
- SVM API specifications: [`/svm/openapi/`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/sim-docs/tree/main/svm/openapi)
