We provide several resources to help you use LLMs and AI coding assistants to build much faster with sim APIs.

## AI Search

First, **AI search** is built directly into this documentation site.
The search bar, powered by Mintlify, can understand natural language queries.
Ask questions about endpoints, authentication, or specific data points, and it will answer you with the most relevant, accurate information.

## Use with LLMs

### Complete Documentation for LLMs

For LLM applications such as custom agents, RAG systems, or any scenario requiring our complete documentation, we provide an optimized text file at [`https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt`](https://docs.sim.dune.com/llms-full.txt).

### Per-Page Access

Each page on this documentation site offers several ways to access its content in LLM-friendly formats:

- **Copy Page:** Copies the fully rendered content of the current page.
- **View Markdown:** Provides a URL with the raw Markdown source. This is ideal for direct input into LLMs.
- **Open with ChatGPT:** Instantly loads the page's content into a new session with ChatGPT. Ask questions, summarize, or generate code based on the page's content.

You can retrieve the Markdown version of any documentation page by appending `.md` to its URL. For example, `/evm/activity` becomes [`https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/activity.md`](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/activity.md).

You can also type `⌘C` or `Ctrl+C` to copy any page's Markdown content.
Try it now.

## Cursor Integration

To integrate our documentation directly into Cursor:

1. Go to Cursor Settings -> Features -> Docs -> Add new doc.
2. Enter "docs.sim.dune.com" in the URL field.
3. Provide a name (e.g., "@simdocs").
4. Hit confirm. The documentation will sync automatically.
5. Reference sim APIs documentation by typing `@simdocs` (or your chosen name) in your Cursor chat window.

## OpenAPI Specifications

For a more compact format, we provide OpenAPI specifications for each of our endpoints. These files detail available parameters, request bodies, and response schemas. This format is particularly useful for LLMs and AI code generation tools to understand our API structure.

You can find our OpenAPI specifications in the following directories:
- EVM API specifications: [`/evm/openapi/`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/sim-docs/tree/main/evm/openapi)
- SVM API specifications: [`/svm/openapi/`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/sim-docs/tree/main/svm/openapi)
