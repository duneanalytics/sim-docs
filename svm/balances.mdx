The Token Balances API provides accurate and fast real time balances of the native, SPL and SPL-2022 tokens of accounts on supported SVM blockchains.
We currently support Solana and Eclipse.

# Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is passed back by the initial response and can be used to fetch the next page of results, by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>

## Compute Unit Cost

The SVM Balances endpoint's CU cost equals the number of chains you include via the `chains` query parameter. For example, `?chains=solana` → 1 CU; `?chains=solana,eclipse` → 2 CUs. See the [Compute Units](/compute-units) page for detailed information.
