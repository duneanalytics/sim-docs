The Token Balances API provides accurate and fast real time balances of the native, SPL and SPL-2022 tokens of accounts on supported SVM blockchains.
We currently support Solana and Eclipse.

<Note>
  - These endpoints are authenticated with a normal Sim API key.
  - Specify `?chains=solana,eclipse` to fetch balances only for select chains.
  - Token metadata includes symbols, decimals, and price information when available.
</Note>


<Note>
The `amount` field is based on `uiAmountString` from the account info (not the raw `amount`) to maintain backward compatibility. The `raw_balance` field provides the raw `amount` divided by 10^decimals, which usually matches `balance` except when contracts implement scaling logic.
</Note>


# Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is passed back by the initial response and can be used to fetch the next page of results, by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>
