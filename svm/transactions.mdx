The Transactions Endpoint allows for quick and accurate lookup of transactions associated with an address.
Data is typically available within 100 ms after a block has been propagated to nodes. We currently only support Solana.

# Ordering

The data is ordered by descending block time, so that new transactions will always be delivered first.


# Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is included in the initial response and can be utilized to fetch the next page of results by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>
