# Parameters

1. `owner` (address as hex string, default: 0x000a22cdb94efbb7260ad038e1b2d377d950ed78)
   1. The owner for which we want to check their portfolio.
2. `chain_id` (uint64, default: 0)
   1. Optional. Can be used to view balances from a certain chain. If unset, defaults to `0` and returns results from all chains.
3. `token_address` (address as hex string, default: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
   1. Optional. Can be used to filter results to a specific token. If unset, defaults to `address(0)` and all tokens are checked.
4. `block_number` (uint64, default: 0)
   1. Optional. Can be used to view allowances at a particular block. If unset, defaults to `0` and returns latest.
5. `limit` (uint32, default: 100)
   1. Number of records you want returned.
6. `offset` (uint32, default: 0)
   1. For pagination. If you're showing ten records per page, choose offset = 9 for the second page.

# Returns

Array with the following fields:

1. `owner` (address as hex string)
   1. The owner for which we checked the portfolio.
2. `chain_id` (int64)
   1. The chain for the token
3. `token_address` (address as hex string)
   1. The token's address.
4. `token_name` (string)
   1. The token's name.
5. `token_symbol` (string)
   1. The token's symbol.
6. `is_for_all` (bool)
   1. `true` for operator approvals (`setApprovalForAll`) and `false` for token-specific approvals (`approve`). See [table usage notes](https://docs.sim.io/reference/ethereum_erc721_approval_changes_block).
7. `operator`(address as hex string)
   1. The operator's address for operator approvals, else `address(0)`.
8. `token_id` (int256 as decimal string)
   1. The token's id for token-specific approvals, else `0`.
9. `approved_address` (address as hex string)
   1. The approved address for token-specific approvals, else `address(0)`.
10. `txn_last_changed` (address as hex string)
    1. The most recent transaction that impacted the approval. Note that this will include ERC721 transfers, which reset approvals (even if none was set).
11. `block_last_changed` (int64)
    1. The most recent block that impacted the approval.

The array is sorted in descending order of `block_last_changed`.
