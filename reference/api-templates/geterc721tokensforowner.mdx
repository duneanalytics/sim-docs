# Parameters

1. `owner` (address as hex string, default: 0x00005fab4df6b1c4a3eb5cf7db357cd766c65991)
   1. The owner for which we want to check their portfolio.
2. `chain_id` (uint64, default: 0)
   1. Optional. Can be used to view balances from a certain chain. If unset, defaults to `0` and returns results from all chains.
3. `block_number` (uint64, default: 0)
   1. Optional. Can be used to view allowances at a particular block. If unset, defaults to `0` and returns latest.
4. `limit` (uint32, default: 100)
   1. Number of records you want returned.
5. `offset` (uint32, default: 0)
   1. For pagination. If you're showing ten records per page, choose offset = 9 for the second page.

# Returns

Array with the following fields:

1. `owner` (address as hex string)
   1. The owner for which we checked the portfolio.
2. `chain_id` (int64)
   1. The chain for the token
3. `token_address` (address as hex string)
   1. The token's address.
4. `token_name` (string)
   1. The token's name.
5. `token_symbol` (string)
   1. The token's symbol.
6. `token_id` (int256 as decimal string)
   1. The token's id.
7. `txn_last_changed` (address as hex string)
   1. The most recent transaction that impacted the token\_id.
8. `block_last_changed` (int64)
   1. The most recent block that impacted token\_id.

The array is sorted in descending order of `block_last_changed`.
