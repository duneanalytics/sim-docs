# Parameters

1. `chain_id` (uint64, default: 1)
2. `token_address` (address as hex string, default: 0xd3d9ddd0cf0a5f0bfb8f7fceae075df687eaebab)
   1. The contract for which we want to check its owners.
3. `block_number` (uint64, default:  0)
   1. Optional. Can be used to view owner at a particular block. If unset, defaults to `0` and returns latest.
4. `limit` (uint32, default: 100)
   1. Number of records you want returned.
5. `offset` (uint32, default: 0)
   1. For pagination. If you're showing ten records per page, choose offset = 9 for the second page.

# Returns

Array with the following fields:

1. `owner` (address as hex string)
   1. The addresses that own at least one token in the contract.
2. `token_id` (int256 as decimal string)
   1. The token\_id owned by the address.
3. `txn_last_changed` (address as hex string)
   1. The most recent transaction that impacted the token\_id.
4. `block_last_changed` (int64)
   1. The most recent block that impacted the token\_id.
