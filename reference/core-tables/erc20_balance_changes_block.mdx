> For efficiency, we only emit one record per block for each `(token_address, account_address)` pair. If there are 2+ changes for the same pair in a given block, we emit the last one. This more efficiently serves queries where you want to know state after a given block, but precludes queries that need intra-block (i.e., transaction-level) state.

# Source

This table was built in sim's [ERC20 Balance Changes - Block](https://studio.sim.io/canvases/57c1df0b-5ab7-472e-abd8-4253f8feca76) canvas. 

# Usage notes

It tracks balance values in the uint256 format of contract storage. For the presentation users expect, divide values here by 10 to the power of d, where `d` is the `decimals()` of the given contract. See sample queries below.
