## Primary Support: Intercom 

Most of our support is provided through **Intercom**, directly accessible from the Sim [web portal](https://sim.dune.com/). Just look for the small chat icon in the bottom-right corner.

Through Intercom, you can:

- Chat with **Blocky**, our Sim AI support agent, powered by Dune
- Get help from the **Dune support team**, either live via chat or asynchronously via email/ticket

We want to help you successfully integrate and use Sim. This page outlines the support channels available to you.

## Developer Community

Join the official Sim [Telegram Group](https://t.me/+nvyoX5xyxNwyNjU0) to connect with other developers, ask questions, and get help from the community.
