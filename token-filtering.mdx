title: "Token Filtering"
description: "Learn how Sim APIs provide liquidity data to help you filter tokens based on your specific needs."

When working with blockchain data, you'll encounter numerous tokens with varying levels of liquidity and utility. Rather than making subjective determinations about what constitutes "spam," Sim APIs provide objective liquidity data that allows you to implement your own filtering logic downstream.

## Our Approach to Token Data

We don't offer spam filtering per se, because we find that definitions of spam are varying and subjective. Instead, we provide the best objective measure that we're aware of—liquidity data—to allow users to filter downstream based on their specific requirements.

For each token in our responses, we include comprehensive metadata that gives you the information needed to make informed filtering decisions:

1. **Token basics**: Name, symbol, and decimals properties
2. **Liquidity information**: Real-time liquidity pool data when available
3. **Price data**: Current USD pricing information
4. **Pool size**: The total value locked in the token's highest liquidity pool

## How Sim Calculates Liquidity Data

Sim's approach to assessing liquidity is sophisticated and real-time:

- For each token, we dynamically track the highest liquidity route to USDC
- We calculate the USD value of the liquidity along that route for each token upon each query
- This provides you with current, accurate liquidity information rather than static or outdated data

## Using Token Data for Custom Filtering

All token responses include the data you need to implement your own filtering logic. Common filtering scenarios include:

1. **Liquidity threshold filtering**: Filter based on the `pool_size` field using your own threshold (e.g., tokens with less than \$100, \$1000, or \$10,000 in liquidity)
2. **Allowlisting specific tokens**: Include certain tokens regardless of their liquidity metrics
3. **Denylisting specific tokens**: Exclude certain tokens even if they meet your liquidity criteria
4. **Custom criteria combinations**: Create your own combination of the available fields to define filtering rules for your application
5. **Token completeness**: Filter based on whether tokens have complete metadata (name, symbol, decimals)

## Available Token Metadata

Every token in our API responses includes:

- `symbol`: Token symbol
- `name`: Token name (when available)
- `decimals`: Token decimal places
- `price_usd`: Current USD price (when available)
- `pool_size`: USD value of the token's highest liquidity pool
- `low_liquidity`: Boolean flag indicating tokens with minimal liquidity

## Applicable APIs

Token filtering capabilities are available for:

- [EVM Balances API](/evm/balances)
- [EVM Activity API](/evm/activity)

## Benefits of Sim's Approach

- **Objective data**: We provide liquidity metrics rather than subjective spam classifications
- **Real-time assessment**: Liquidity is checked at query time, not based on outdated lists
- **Flexibility**: All filtering data is provided, allowing you to implement custom logic that fits your use case
- **Transparency**: You have full visibility into the data used for filtering decisions
- **Adaptability**: Your filtering criteria can evolve with your application's needs

By leveraging Sim's comprehensive token metadata, you can provide your users with a curated view of blockchain data that aligns with your specific requirements and use case.
