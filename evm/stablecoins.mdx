The Stablecoin Balances API provides a dedicated endpoint for retrieving only stablecoin holdings for a wallet across supported EVM chains. This is a specialized version of the [Balances](/evm/balances) endpoint that filters results to include only configured stablecoins.

<SupportedChains endpoint="balances" />

## Supported Stablecoins

The endpoint includes stablecoins from three categories:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Standard** | USD-pegged stablecoins | USDC, USDT, DAI, BUSD |
| **Yield-bearing** | Stablecoins that accrue yield | sDAI, sUSDe |
| **Euro-pegged** | EUR-pegged stablecoins | EURC, EURe |

<Info>
  The stablecoin category is used for filtering only and is not included in the response. The response format is identical to the standard Balances endpoint.
</Info>

<Note>
  On Gnosis chain (chain_id: 100), the native token xDAI is a stablecoin and will be included in results with `address: "native"`.
</Note>

## Alternative Access

You can also access stablecoin balances through the main [Balances](/evm/balances) endpoint using the `asset_class` query parameter:

```bash
curl -s -X GET 'https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045?asset_class=stablecoin&chain_ids=1,8453' \
  -H 'X-Sim-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Both methods return identical results.

## Token Prices

Stablecoin prices are determined using onchain liquidity pools, the same as the standard Balances endpoint. Most stablecoins will show a price close to their peg (e.g., ~$1.00 for USD-pegged stablecoins).

You can include `metadata=pools` in your request to see which liquidity pool was used for pricing each stablecoin.

## Compute Unit Cost

The Stablecoin Balances endpoint's CU cost equals the number of chains you include via the `chain_ids` query parameter, the same as the standard Balances endpoint.

<Note>
  If you omit `chain_ids`, the endpoint uses its `default` chain set, which equals {<DefaultChainCount endpoint="balances" />} chains at request time. See the tags section of the <a href="/evm/supported-chains#tags">Supported Chains</a> page.
</Note>

## Historical Prices

You can request historical point-in-time prices by adding the `historical_prices` query parameter. Use whole numbers to specify the number of hours in the past. You can request up to three offsets.

```bash
curl -s -X GET 'https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045/stablecoins?chain_ids=1&historical_prices=168' \
  -H 'X-Sim-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

When set, each balance includes a `historical_prices` array:

```json
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "symbol": "USDC",
      "price_usd": 1.0001,
      "historical_prices": [
        { "offset_hours": 168, "price_usd": 0.9998 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Pagination

This endpoint uses cursor-based pagination, identical to the Balances endpoint. Use the `limit` query parameter to define the maximum page size. The `next_offset` value from the response can be used to fetch subsequent pages.

```bash
# First page
curl -s -X GET 'https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045/stablecoins?limit=10' \
  -H 'X-Sim-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'

# Next page (using next_offset from previous response)
curl -s -X GET 'https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045/stablecoins?limit=10&offset=NEXT_OFFSET_VALUE' \
  -H 'X-Sim-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```
