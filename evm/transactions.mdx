![Transaction Sv](/images/transaction.svg)

The Transactions API allows for quick and accurate lookup of transactions associated with an address.
Transactions are ordered by descending block time, so the most recent transactions appear first.

<SupportedChains endpoint="transactions" />

## Decoded transactions

Enable decoded transaction data and logs by adding the `?decode=true` query parameter to your request.
When decoding is enabled, two types of data may be decoded:

1. **Transaction call data**: The `data` field of each transaction may include an additional `decoded` object at the root level of the transaction, representing the parsed function call.
2. **Event logs**: When a transaction contains EVM logs, each log may include an additional `decoded` object representing the parsed event.

For more details, see the [response information](#response-logs-decoded) below.

<Note>
  Decoding is only available for contracts that exist on [Dune.com](https://dune.com). Search for your contract on Dune to check if it's available for decoding. Transactions without logs, logs without known signatures, or contracts not indexed on Dune **will not** include decoded data.
</Note>

## Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination.
You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is included in the initial response and can be utilized to fetch the next page of results by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>
  You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.
</Warning>

## Compute Unit Cost

The Transactions endpoint has a fixed CU cost of **1** per request. See the [Compute Units](/compute-units) page for detailed information.
