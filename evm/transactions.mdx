The Transactions API allows for quick and accurate lookup of transactions associated with an address.
Transactions are ordered by descending block time, so the most recent transactions appear first.

## Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination.
You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is included in the initial response and can be utilized to fetch the next page of results by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>
  You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.
