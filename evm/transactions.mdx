![Transaction Sv](/images/transaction.svg)

The Transactions API allows for quick and accurate lookup of transactions associated with an address.
Transactions are ordered by descending block time, so the most recent transactions appear first.

<SupportedChains endpoint="transactions" />

## Decoded transactions

Enable decoded transaction data and logs by adding the `?decode=true` query parameter to your request.
When decoding is enabled, two types of data may be decoded:

1. **Transaction call data**: The `data` field of each transaction may include an additional `decoded` object at the root level of the transaction, representing the parsed function call.
2. **Event logs**: When a transaction contains EVM logs, each log may include an additional `decoded` object representing the parsed event.

For more details, see the [response information](#response-logs-decoded) below.

<Note>
  Decoding is only available for contracts that exist on [Dune.com](https://dune.com). Search for your contract on Dune to check if it's available for decoding. Transactions without logs, logs without known signatures, or contracts not indexed on Dune **will not** include decoded data.
</Note>

## Warnings

When requesting transactions for specific chains using the `chain_ids` parameter, the API may return warnings if some requested chain IDs are not supported. Unlike errors, warnings indicate non-fatal issues where the request can still be partially fulfilled.

When unsupported chain IDs are included in your request, the API will:
- Return transactions for all supported chains you requested
- Include a `warnings` array in the response with details about the unsupported chains

### Example: Request with Unsupported Chain IDs

If you request `?chain_ids=1,9999,10`, the API returns transactions for chains 1 and 10 (supported), and includes a warning about chain 9999 (unsupported):

<Tip>
  Check the [Supported Chains](/evm/supported-chains) page to see which chains are currently supported for the Transactions endpoint.
</Tip>

## Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination.
You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is included in the initial response and can be utilized to fetch the next page of results by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>
  You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.
</Warning>

## Compute Unit Cost

The Transactions endpoint has a fixed CU cost of **1** per request. See the [Compute Units](/compute-units) page for detailed information.
