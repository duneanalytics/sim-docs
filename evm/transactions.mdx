![Transaction Sv](/images/transaction.svg)

The Transactions API allows for quick and accurate lookup of transactions associated with an address.
Transactions are ordered by descending block time, so the most recent transactions appear first.

<SupportedChains endpoint="transactions" />

## Decoded transactions

Enable decoded logs by adding the `?decode=true` query parameter to your request.
When a transaction contains EVM logs, each log may include an additional `decoded` object representing the parsed event.
See the [specification](#response-logs-decoded) below for response details.

<Note>
  Transactions without logs, or logs without a known signature, **will not** include decoded logs.
</Note>

## Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination.
You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is included in the initial response and can be utilized to fetch the next page of results by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>
  You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.
