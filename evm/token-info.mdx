The Tokens API provides metadata and realtime pricing information for native and ERC20 tokens on supported EVM blockchains. The API returns:

- Token metadata (symbol, name, decimals)
- Current USD pricing information
- Supply information
- Logo URLs when available

<Note>
  The `?chain_ids` query parameter is mandatory.
  To fetch tokens for _all_ supported chains, pass the `?chain_ids=all` query parameter.
  You can also specify specific chains with `?chain_ids=11,250,1`.

## Token Prices

Sim looks up prices onchain. We use the most liquid onchain pair to determine a usd price. We return the available liquidity in `pool_size` as part of the response.

## Pagination

This endpoint uses cursor-based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is included in the initial response and can be utilized to fetch the next page of results by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>
  You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.
