import { SupportedChains } from '/snippets/supported-chains.mdx';

The DeFi Positions API returns a wallet's active positions across liquidity pools, lending protocols, yield strategies, and tokenized DeFi assets.
Each position includes token holdings, USD valuations, underlying asset metadata, and protocol-specific details such as tick ranges, collateral status, or reward accruals.

Use this endpoint to build portfolio dashboards, risk analytics, or unified position views without querying individual protocol contracts.

<SupportedChains endpoint="defi_positions" />

<Note>
This endpoint is currently available at the beta path (`/beta/evm/defi/positions`).
Schemas are stable, but response fields may expand as we onboard new protocols.
Also, **Arbitrum support is not currently available but is coming soon**.
</Note>

## Supported Protocols

Protocol coverage is organized by position type. Each protocol specifies its supported chains and the API response type under which it appears.

## Compute Units

Each request consumes two Compute Units per processed chain ID. Filtering to fewer chains lowers usage. Aggregations are calculated server-side and included in the same response.

## Request Parameters

- `chain_ids` — Optional chain filter accepting numeric IDs or supported tags. When omitted, we return all chains tagged as `default`.
- `protocol` — Filter to a specific protocol or category (`aave-v3`, `uniswap-v3`, `erc4626`, etc.).

All requests require the `X-Sim-Api-Key` header with a Sim API key.

## Response Structure

Each response includes the queried wallet, timestamps, an array of positions, and aggregation totals.

- `positions[]` items surface consistent metadata across protocols:
  - **Protocol identifiers:** `protocol_name`, `protocol_id`, and protocol-defined `label`
  - **Location:** `chain_id` and `contract_address`
  - **Valuation:** `amount`, `usd_value`, and `unclaimed_usd_value`
  - **details:** Protocol-specific fields such as token breakdowns, APYs, collateral flags, NFT ticks, or reward inventories. The shape of this object varies by integration and expands over time.

- `aggregations.total_usd_value` sums the USD value of all returned positions.
- `aggregations.total_by_chain` breaks down USD value per chain ID.
