This guide demonstrates how to build an AI-powered crypto data chatbot.
This type of application allows users to ask complex crypto-related questions in natural language.
For example:

- 'What's Vitalik's ETH balance?'
- 'Convert 1 ETH to BTC'

These are then translated into queries for the Dune Echo API.
The AI formats the API's response into a clear, conversational answer, making on-chain data accessible to a wider audience.

Let's get started building it.
