Now that you have a wallet capable of showing realtime token balances, let's enhance it with an account activity tab.
In this second guide, you'll provide users with a clear list of their onchain interactions.
We'll integrate the [Activity API](/evm/activity) to make it happen.

<Note>
This guide assumes you've completed the first guide, [Create a Realtime Wallet](/evm/build-a-realtime-wallet), to display token balances.
