Partially updates a webhook subscription. You can modify any of the webhook's properties or manage the subscribed addresses without having to resend the entire configuration.

<Note>
Only include the fields you want to update. All other properties will remain unchanged.
</Note>

## Example Use Cases

### Pause a Webhook

To temporarily stop receiving webhook deliveries without deleting the webhook:

```json
{
  "active": false
}
```

### Update Destination URL

```json
{
  "url": "https://new-endpoint.example.com/webhooks"
}
```

### Change Chain Filter

```json
{
  "chain_ids": [1, 10, 8453]
}
```

## Managing Addresses

You can also use this endpoint to add or remove addresses from the webhook subscription.

<Note>
If you need to replace the entire address list at once, use the [Replace Webhook Addresses](/evm/subscriptions/replace-webhook-addresses) endpoint instead.
</Note>

### Add New Addresses

```json
{
  "add_addresses": [
    "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
    "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
  ]
}
```

### Remove Addresses

```json
{
  "remove_addresses": [
    "0x3f60008Dfd0EfC03F476D9B489D6C5B13B3eBF2C"
  ]
}
```

### Add and Remove in One Request

<Tip>
You can add and remove addresses in the same request. The removal happens first, followed by the additions.
</Tip>

```json
{
  "add_addresses": [
    "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb"
  ],
  "remove_addresses": [
    "0x3f60008Dfd0EfC03F476D9B489D6C5B13B3eBF2C"
  ]
}
```

### Combine Property and Address Updates

You can update webhook properties and manage addresses in a single request:

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "chain_ids": [1, 8453],
  "add_addresses": [
    "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb"
  ]
}
```
