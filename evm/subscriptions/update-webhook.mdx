Partially updates a webhook subscription's configuration. You can modify any of the webhook's properties without having to resend the entire configuration.

<Note>
Only include the fields you want to update. All other properties will remain unchanged.
</Note>

<Tip>
To manage subscribed addresses (add/remove), use the [Update Addresses](/evm/subscriptions/update-webhook-addresses) endpoint instead.

## Example Use Cases

### Pause a Webhook

To temporarily stop receiving webhook deliveries without deleting the webhook:

```json
{
  "active": false
}
```

### Update Destination URL

```json
{
  "url": "https://new-endpoint.example.com/webhooks"
}
```

### Change Chain Filter

```json
{
  "chain_ids": [1, 10, 8453]
}
```

### Update Multiple Properties

You can update multiple properties in a single request:

```json
{
  "name": "Updated USDC Monitor",
  "active": true,
  "chain_ids": [1, 8453]
}
```
