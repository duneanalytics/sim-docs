Permanently deletes a webhook subscription. This action cannot be undone.

<Warning>
Deleting a webhook is permanent. If you only need to temporarily stop receiving events, consider using the [Update Webhook](/evm/subscriptions/update-webhook) endpoint to set `active: false` instead.
</Warning>

After deletion:
- No new webhook deliveries will be sent
- The webhook ID becomes invalid
- All subscribed addresses are removed
- Historical delivery logs may still be visible in your dashboard
