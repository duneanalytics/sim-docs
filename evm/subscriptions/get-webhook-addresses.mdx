openapi: "/evm/openapi/subscriptions/webhooks.json GET /beta/evm/subscriptions/webhooks/{webhookId}/addresses"
---

Returns a paginated list of all wallet addresses that are currently subscribed to the specified webhook. This is useful for:

- Auditing which addresses are being monitored
- Verifying address subscriptions
- Exporting your subscription list

## Pagination

This endpoint uses cursor-based pagination. Use the `limit` parameter to control page size, and pass the `next_offset` value from the response as the `offset` parameter to retrieve the next page.

<Tip>
If you're managing a large number of addresses (hundreds or thousands), use pagination to efficiently retrieve the complete list.
