---

Add or remove individual addresses from a webhook subscription without replacing the entire list. This is useful when you want to incrementally manage your subscribed addresses.

<Note>
If you need to replace the entire address list at once, use the [Replace Webhook Addresses](/evm/subscriptions/replace-webhook-addresses) endpoint instead.
</Note>

## Example Use Cases

### Add New Addresses

Add one or more addresses to your existing subscription:

```json
{
  "add_addresses": [
    "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
    "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
  ]
}
```

### Remove Addresses

Remove addresses that you no longer want to monitor:

```json
{
  "remove_addresses": [
    "0x3f60008Dfd0EfC03F476D9B489D6C5B13B3eBF2C"
  ]
}
```

### Add and Remove in One Request

<Tip>
You can add and remove addresses in the same request. The removal happens first, followed by the additions.
</Tip>

```json
{
  "add_addresses": [
    "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb"
  ],
  "remove_addresses": [
    "0x3f60008Dfd0EfC03F476D9B489D6C5B13B3eBF2C"
  ]
}
```

<Note>
This endpoint only manages addresses. To update other webhook properties like name, URL, or status, use the [Update Webhook](/evm/subscriptions/update-webhook) endpoint.
