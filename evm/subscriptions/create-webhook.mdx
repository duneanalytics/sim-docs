Creates a new webhook subscription. When creating a webhook, you must specify:

- **name**: A descriptive name for your webhook
- **url**: The endpoint where webhook payloads will be sent
- **type**: The type of events to subscribe to (`transactions`, `activities`, or `balances`)
- **addresses**: An array of wallet addresses to monitor

## Optional Filters

You can narrow down the events you receive by adding optional filters:

- **chain_ids**: Monitor only specific chains (e.g., `[1, 8453]` for Ethereum and Base)
- **transaction_type**: For transaction webhooks, filter by `sender` or `receiver`
- **counterparty**: Filter transactions by counterparty address
- **activity_type**: For activity webhooks, filter by specific types (`send`, `receive`, `swap`, etc.)
- **asset_type**: Filter by asset type (`native`, `erc20`, `erc721`, `erc1155`)
- **token_address**: Monitor only a specific token contract

<Tip>
Start with broad filters and narrow them down based on your app's needs. This helps reduce unnecessary webhook deliveries.
