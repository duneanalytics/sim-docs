Replaces the entire list of subscribed addresses for a webhook. The new list completely overwrites the existing addresses.

Use this endpoint when you want to:
- Replace the entire address list with a new set
- Reset the subscription to monitor a different set of addresses
- Perform a bulk update of all addresses at onc

<Warning>
This endpoint replaces ALL existing addresses.
Any addresses not included in the new list will be removed from the subscription.
If you only need to add or remove specific addresses without replacing the entire list, use the [Update Webhook](/evm/subscriptions/update-webhook) endpoint instead.
</Warning>
