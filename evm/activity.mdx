![Activity Sv](/images/activity.svg)

The Activity API provides a realtime feed of onchain activity for any EVM address.
The newest activity is returned first and includes the following activity types:

- **send** - Outgoing transfers of tokens or native assets
- **receive** - Incoming transfers of tokens or native assets  
- **mint** - Token minting activities
- **burn** - Token burning activities
- **swap** - Token swaps and exchanges
- **approve** - Token approval transactions
- **call** - Generic contract interactions that don't fall into the above categories

Each activity includes detailed information such as:
- Native token transfers
- ERC20 token transfers with metadata (symbol, decimals)
- ERC721 (NFT) transfers with token IDs
- Contract interactions with decoded function calls

<SupportedChains endpoint="activity" />

<Callout type="info">
Activities are mostly indexed events. There are, of course, no events for native token transfers (wen [7708](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7708-eth-transfers-emit-a-log/20034)?). We do have a heuristic to catch very simple native token transfers, where the native token transfer is the entirety of the transaction, but unfortunately we don't currently catch native token transfers that happen within internal txns.

## Data Finality & Re-orgs

Sim APIs are designed to automatically detect and handle blockchain re-organizations.
We detect any potentially broken parent-child block relationships as soon as they arise and update our internal state to match the onchain state, typically within a few hundred milliseconds.
This re-org handling is an automatic, non-configurable feature designed to provide the most reliable data.

## Warnings

When requesting activity for specific chains using the `chain_ids` parameter, the API may return warnings if some requested chain IDs are not supported. Unlike errors, warnings indicate non-fatal issues where the request can still be partially fulfilled.

When unsupported chain IDs are included in your request, the API will:
- Return activity for all supported chains you requested
- Include a `warnings` array in the response with details about the unsupported chains

### Example: Request with Unsupported Chain IDs

If you request `?chain_ids=1,9999,10`, the API returns activity for chains 1 and 10 (supported), and includes a warning about chain 9999 (unsupported):

```json

  "activity": [
    {
      "chain_id": 1,
      "block_number": 18500000,

      }
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    {
      "code": "UNSUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS",
      "message": "Some requested chain_ids are not supported. Activity is returned only for supported chains.",

}
```

## Filtering

You can filter activities server-side using the following query parameters:

- **`token_address`** — Filter by token contract address. For example, pass the USDC contract address to return only USDC-related activity. Note: swap and call activities do not have a single token address, so they are always excluded when this filter is set. Native transfers are also excluded since they have no token contract.
- **`activity_type`** — Filter by activity type. Accepts a single value or a comma-separated list. Accepted values: `send`, `receive`, `mint`, `burn`, `swap`, `approve`, `call`.
- **`asset_type`** — Filter by asset standard. Accepts a single value or a comma-separated list. Accepted values: `native`, `erc20`, `erc721`, `erc1155`. Use `native` to include native token transfers (e.g. ETH). Contract call activities have no asset type and are excluded when this filter is set.

All filters are optional and can be combined. For example, to get only native token receives:

```
GET /v1/evm/activity/{address}?activity_type=receive&asset_type=native
```

To get only sends and receives (multi-value):

```
GET /v1/evm/activity/{address}?activity_type=send,receive
```

Or to get only USDC sends:

```
GET /v1/evm/activity/{address}?token_address=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&activity_type=send
```

For additional client-side filtering, we include all the data needed in the responses. See our [Token Filtering](/token-filtering) guide for more details.

## Compute Unit Cost

The Activity endpoint has a fixed CU cost of **3** per request. See the [Compute Units](/compute-units) page for detailed information.
