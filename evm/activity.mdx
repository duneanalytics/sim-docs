The Activity API provides a realtime feed of onchain activity for any EVM address.
The newest activity is returned first and includes:

- Native token transfers
- ERC20 token transfers with metadata (symbol, decimals)
- ERC721 (NFT) transfers with token IDs
- Contract interactions with decoded function calls

## Spam Tokens

The Activity API supports filtering out activities related to spam tokens using the `?exclude_spam_tokens` parameter. When specified, this parameter will exclude transactions and transfers involving tokens that meet spam criteria, providing a cleaner activity feed.

We include all the data needed for custom filtering in the responses, allowing you to implement your own filtering logic. For a detailed explanation of our spam filtering approach, see our [Spam Token Filtering](/spam-filtering) guide.
