The Activity endpoint provides a real-time feed of on-chain activity for any EVM address. Activity is returned in chronological order (newest first) and includes:

- Native token transfers
- ERC20 token transfers with metadata (symbol, decimals)
- ERC721 (NFT) transfers with token IDs
- Contract interactions with decoded function calls

<Note>
  This endpoint is currently in beta and requires authentication using a normal Dune API key.
