The Collectibles API provides information about NFTs (ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens) owned by a specific address on supported EVM blockchains, with built-in spam filtering.

<SupportedChains endpoint="collectibles" />

## Compute Unit Cost

The Collectibles endpoint’s CU cost equals the number of chains you include via the `chain_ids` query parameter. If you omit `chain_ids`, we use the endpoint’s chains tagged `default` (currently {<DefaultChainCount endpoint="collectibles" />} chains, subject to change). See the [Supported Chains](/evm/supported-chains#tags) page to learn about chain tags.

For example, `?chain_ids=1,8453,137` processes three chains and currently consumes three CUs. Omitting `chain_ids` uses the default set at request time and consumes {<DefaultChainCount endpoint="collectibles" />} CUs (equal to the size of that set).

<Note>
See the [Compute Units](/compute-units) page for detailed information.

## Spam Filtering

By default, spam filtering for collectibles is enabled. Use `filter_spam=false` to disable it. You can omit the parameter or set `filter_spam=true` to keep spam filtering enabled.

We provide spam scores to explain how a collectible is classified as spam or not.
Spam scores are _off_ by default. Enable them with `show_spam_scores=true`.
Scores are computed as a weighted average across signals.
These include whether the collection has been flagged by external providers, trade volume since launch, and the number of unique buyers and sellers.
See the table below for the full list.

<Accordion title="Spam Scoring Signals" icon="shield">

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `trade_volume` | This is the total number of trades since collection launch. Very low activity can indicate spam. Collections launched in the last 7 days are excluded from this signal. |
| `unique_buyers` | This is the count of distinct buyers. Low buyer diversity can indicate inorganic activity. |
| `unique_sellers` | This is the count of distinct sellers. Low seller diversity can indicate inorganic activity. |
| `externally_flagged` | Whether the collection has been flagged as spam by third-party providers. `true` increases the spam likelihood. |
| `ipfs_uri_present` | This indicates whether token metadata URIs use IPFS. Certain patterns can correlate with spam when combined with other signals. |
| `suspicious_words` | Whether names, symbols, or URIs include suspicious terms commonly associated with scams. |
| `url_shortener_in_uri` | This indicates whether metadata URIs use link shorteners. For example, Bitly links can obscure destinations. |

These spam score features are included in the response's `explanations` field and may be omitted if signals are unavailable.
