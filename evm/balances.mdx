The Token Balances API provides accurate and fast real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on supported EVM blockchains.

<Note>
  The Balances API only returns balances for certain low latency chains by default.
  To fetch balances for _all_ supported chains, use the `?chains_ids=all` query parameter.
</Note>

## Token Prices

Sim looks up prices onchain. We use the most liquid onchain pair to determine a USD price. We return the available liquidity in `pool_size` as part of the response, and show a warning `low_liquidity:	true` if this value is less than \$10k.

## Token Filtering

We also include the `pool_size` field in all responses, allowing you to implement custom filtering logic based on your specific requirements. For a detailed explanation of our approach, see our [Token Filtering](/token-filtering) guide.

## Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination. You can use the `limit` query parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is passed back by the initial response and can be used to fetch the next page of results, by passing it as the `offet` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>
  You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` query parameter of the next page of results.
</Warning>
