The Token Balances API provides accurate and fast real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on supported EVM blockchains.
Data is typically available within 100 ms since a block was propagated to nodes.

<Note>
The Balances API only returns balances for certain low latency chains by default.
To fetch balances for _all_ supported chains, use the `?chains_ids=all` query parameter.

## Token Prices

Sim looks up prices onchain. We use the most liquid onchain pair to determine a USD price. We return the available liquidity in `pool_size` as part of the response, and show a warning `low_liquidity:	true` if this value is less than \$10k.

## Spam Tokens

By default the API filters out any token with `symbol = ''`, `symbol.length > 15`, `name = ''` or `decimals = 0`.
When the `?exclude_spam_tokens` is specified we use [this Dune query](https://dune.com/queries/3804603) to determine if something is spam. Additionally, we remove any token with less than \$100 of onchain liquidity.

## Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination. You can use the `limit` query parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is passed back by the initial response and can be used to fetch the next page of results, by passing it as the `offet` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>
  You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` query parameter of the next page of results.
</Warning>
