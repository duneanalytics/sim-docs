![Balance Sv](/images/balance.svg)

The Token Balances API provides accurate and fast real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on supported EVM blockchains.

<SupportedChains endpoint="balances" />

## Token Prices

Sim looks up prices onchain. We use the most liquid onchain pair to determine a USD price. We return the available liquidity in `pool_size` as part of the response, and show a warning `low_liquidity:	true` if this value is less than \$10k.

## Token Filtering

We also include the `pool_size` field in all responses, allowing you to implement custom filtering logic based on your specific requirements. For a detailed explanation of our approach, see our [Token Filtering](/token-filtering) guide.

### Exclude tokens with less than 100 USD liquidity

Use the optional `exclude_spam_tokens` query parameter to automatically filter out tokens with less than 100 USD of liquidity. Include the query parameter `exclude_spam_tokens=true` so that those tokens are excluded from the response entirely. This is distinct from the `low_liquidity` field in the response, which is `true` when liquidity is below 10,000. To learn more about how Sim calculates liquidity data, visit the [Token Filtering](/token-filtering) guide.

## Compute Unit Cost

The Balances endpoint’s CU cost equals the number of chains you include via the `chain_ids` query parameter.
For example, `?chain_ids=1,8453,137` processes three chains and consumes three CUs.

<Note>
  If you omit `chain_ids`, the endpoint uses its `default` chain set (low-latency networks), which equals {<DefaultChainCount endpoint="balances" />} chains at request time (subject to change). See the tags section of the <a href="/evm/supported-chains#tags">Supported Chains</a> page and the <a href="/compute-units">Compute Units</a> page for details.
</Note>

## Historical prices

You can request historical point-in-time prices by adding the `historical_prices` query parameter. Use whole numbers to specify the number of hours in the past. You can request up to three offsets. For example, `&historical_prices=168` returns the price 168 hours (1 week) ago. `&historical_prices=720,168,24` returns prices 720 hours (1 month) ago, 168 hours (1 week) ago, and 24 hours ago.

<Note>
  The `historical_prices` parameter is currently supported only on the EVM Balances and EVM Token Info endpoints.
</Note>

When set, each balance includes a `historical_prices` array with one entry per offset:

```json
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "symbol": "ETH",
      "price_usd": 3896.8315,
      "historical_prices": [
        { "offset_hours": 8760, "price_usd": 2816.476803 },
        { "offset_hours": 720,  "price_usd": 3710.384068 },
        { "offset_hours": 168,  "price_usd": 3798.632723 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Percent changes are not returned**. You can compute your own differences using the `price_usd` on the balance and the values in `historical_prices[].price_usd`.

<Warning>
  The maximum number of historical price offsets is 3. If more than 3 are provided, the API returns an error.
</Warning>

## Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination. You can use the `limit` query parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is passed back by the initial response and can be used to fetch the next page of results, by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>
  You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` query parameter of the next page of results.
</Warning>

## Single token balance

Use the token sub-path of the Balances endpoint to fetch a wallet’s balance for one token on one chain.

This sub-path accepts exactly one chain via the `chain_ids` query parameter.
