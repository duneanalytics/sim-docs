Sim IDX is a framework that radically simplifies the process of indexing blockchain data.
This guide will walk you through installing the CLI, initializing a sample project, and running your first listener test.

## Install CLI

<Steps>
<Step title="Download & Install Dependencies">
  First, ensure you have **Node.js v20.x or later** installed.
  You can download it from [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
  ```bash
  # Check your node version
  node -v 
  ```
</Step>
<Step title="Install the CLI">
  ```bash
  curl -L https://simcli.dune.com | bash
  ```

  You'll see the following output:

  ```text
  [INFO] Installing sim CLI v0.0.53
  [INFO] Installing sim to /root/.local/bin/sim
  [INFO] sim CLI installed successfully!
  [INFO] Added sim CLI to PATH in /root/.bashrc
  ```

  <Info>
    After the installer finishes, run `source ~/.bashrc` (or the appropriate profile file) so the `sim` executable is available in your `PATH`.
  </Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Verify Installation">
  Verify that the CLI is working:
  ```bash
  sim --version
  ```
  
  You'll see:
  
  ```
  sim v0.0.53 (eaddf2 2025-06-22T18:01:14.000000000Z)
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Initialize Sample App

First, create a new folder.

```bash
mkdir my-first-idx-app
cd my-first-idx-app
```

Next, initialize your new Sim IDX app.

```bash
sim init
```

This command initializes **a pre-configured sample app that indexes every new Uniswap V3 trading pool created on the Ethereum blockchain**.
It sets up a complete app structure for you, including a listener contract, tests, and a boilerplate API.

<Info>
  `sim init` also initializes a new Git repository and makes the first commit.
  Make sure Git is installed and configured. Otherwise the command might fail.
</Info>

After successfully running init, you'll see:

```text
INFO sim::init: Successfully initialized a new Sim IDX app
```

## Authentication

Create a new API key in the [Sim dashboard](https://sim.dune.com/) so you can authenticate in the CLI and test your new sample app.

<Frame caption="To generate a new API key, visit the Keys page and click the New button.">
  <img src="/images/idx/sim-idx-authentication.png" />
</Frame>

Give your new API key a unique name and select **Sim IDX CLI** for the key's purpose.
After you've created your key, copy its value, go back to the CLI, and run:

```bash
sim authenticate
```

Paste the API key you created and press Enter.
Once you've successfully authenticated, you'll see the following:

```
INFO sim::authenticate: Verifying API Key...
INFO sim::authenticate: API Key verified successfully.
INFO sim::authenticate: API Key successfully saved.
```

## Test Your Listener

Now you can test to make sure your sample app's listener is working correctly:

```bash
sim listeners execute \
  --start-block 22757345 \
  --chain-id 1
```

After the command finishes, you'll see a summary of indexed events.
If everything succeeds, your listener is working correctly.

## Next Steps

You've now got a working contract listener.
Next, you'll deploy your app so it can index data continuously.
If you'd like to go further, you can refine and extend your listener to capture even more onchain data.
