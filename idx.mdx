Sim IDX is a framework that radically simplifies the process of indexing blockchain data.
You write simple Solidity "listener" contracts to specify what onchain data you're interested in, and Sim IDX automatically indexes that data and provides you with the tools to query it and build custom APIs.

This guide will walk you through installing the CLI, initializing a sample project, and running your first listener test.

## Install CLI

<Steps>
<Step title="Download & Install the CLI">
  ```bash
  curl -L https://simcli.dune.com | bash
  ```

  <Info>
    After the installer finishes, run `source ~/.bashrc` (or the appropriate profile file) so the `sim` executable is available in your <code>PATH</code>.
  </Info>

  You'll see the following output:

  ```text
  [INFO] Installing sim CLI v0.0.52
  [INFO] Installing sim to /home/ubuntu/.local/bin/sim
  [INFO] sim CLI installed successfully!
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Installation">
  Verify the CLI is working:
  ```bash
  sim --version
  ```
  
  You'll see:
  
  ```
  sim v0.0.52 (1ea90e 2025-06-21T10:18:43.000000000Z)
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Initialize Sample App

First, create a new folder.

```bash
mkdir my-first-idx-app
cd my-first-idx-app
```

Next, initialize your new Sim IDX app.

```bash
sim init
```

This command initializes **a pre-configured sample app that indexes every new Uniswap V3 trading pool created on the Ethereum blockchain**.
It sets up a complete project structure for you, including a listener contract, tests, and a boilerplate API.

<Info>
  `sim init` also initializes a new Git repository and makes the first commit.
  Make sure Git is installed and configured.

## Authentication

Create a new API key in the [Sim dashboard](https://sim.dune.com/) so you can authenticate in the CLI and test your new sample app.

<Frame caption="To generate a new API key, visit the Keys page and click the New button.">
  <img src="/images/idx/sim-idx-authentication.png" />
</Frame>

Give your new API key a unique name and select **Sim IDX CLI** for the key's purpose.
After you've created your key, copy its value, and go back to the CLI.

Run the following command:

```bash
sim authenticate
```

Paste the API key you created and press Enter.
Once you've successfully authenticated, you'll see the following:

```
INFO sim::authenticate: Verifying API Key...
INFO sim::authenticate: API Key verified successfully.
INFO sim::authenticate: API Key successfully saved.
```

## Test Your Listener

Now you can test your app to make sure your sample app's listener is working correctly:

```bash
sim listeners execute \
  --start-block 22744766 \
  --chain-id 1
```

When the command finishes you'll see a summary of indexed events and any database writes. If everything succeeds, your listener is working.

## Next Steps

You've now got a working listener and a taste of how Sim IDX speeds up blockchain indexing.
