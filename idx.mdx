Sim IDX is a framework that radically simplifies the process of indexing blockchain data.
You write simple Solidity "listener" contracts to specify what onchain data you're interested in, and Sim IDX automatically indexes that data and provides you with the tools to build custom APIs to query it.

This guide will walk you through installing the CLI, initializing a sample project, and running your first listener test.

## Install CLI

The CLI is your primary tool for interacting with the Sim IDX framework.

<Steps>
<Step title="Download the CLI">
  Download [the latest release ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/137naBu5bFX-6stc8x9fTyggApnT3w9Xx) of Sim CLI for your platform.
</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">
  Install the required dependencies:
  
  ```bash
  # Install Foundry (nightly version)
  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && foundryup --install nightly
  ```

  <Info>
    Sim IDX uses the nightly version of Foundry. We're working to simplify this setup process. If you have trouble getting this working on your current system, consider setting up an Ubuntu machine. We'll have a Docker container available soon to make this even easier.
  </Info>

  For the best development experience, also install [the Hardhat VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) for Solidity code completion when editing listeners.

</Step>

<Step title="Extract and Setup">
  Extract the downloaded file and make it executable:
  
  ```bash
  # Extract the tar file (replace with your downloaded filename)
  tar -xvzf sim_v0.0.27_linux_amd64.tar.gz
  ```

  <Info>
  **Mac users**: You must run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./sim`.
  </Info>

  ```bash
  # Make it executable
  chmod +x ./sim
  
  # Move to system bin (optional - allows you to run 'sim' from anywhere)
  sudo mv ./sim /usr/bin/sim
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Installation">
  Verify the CLI is working:
  ```bash
  sim --version
  ```
  
  You should see output similar to:
  
  ```
  sim  (984668 2025-06-02T15:34:14.000000000Z)
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Initialize Sample App

Create and initialize your first Sim IDX app

```bash
mkdir my-first-idx-app
cd my-first-idx-app
sim init
```

This command initializes **a pre-configured sample app that indexes every new Uniswap V3 trading pool created on the Ethereum blockchain**.
It sets up a complete project structure for you, including a listener contract, tests, and a boilerplate API.

## Test Your Listener

Run a quick dry-run against mainnet to make sure everything is wired up correctly:

```bash
sim deploy test \
  --start-block 22744766 \
  --chain-id 1
```

When the command finishes you'll see a summary of indexed events and any database writes. If everything succeeds, your listener is working.

<Details title="Example output">

```text
✅ Compiled listener
ℹ️  Replaying block 22744766 on chain 1…

{
  "events_processed": 1,
  "db_writes": 1,
  "triggers": [
    {
      "name": "PoolCreated",
      "pool": "0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8",
      "txHash": "0x…"
    }
  ]
}

✔ Test finished in 3 s
```

</Details>

If the command finishes without errors, your listener is working.

## Next Steps

You've now got a working listener and a taste of how Sim IDX speeds up blockchain indexing.
