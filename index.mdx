Sim APIs power wallets and onchain apps with fast, reliable access to real-time blockchain activity and ownership data.
Access data from 60+ chains with a single request.

This guide will help you make your first API call to retrieve multichain token balances for an address.

## Authentication

Sim APIs use API keys to authenticate requests.
You can create and manage your API keys in your [Sim Dashboard](https://sim.dune.com/).

<Frame caption="To generate a new API key, visit the Keys page and click the New button.">
  <img src="/images/get-sim-api-key.png" />
</Frame>

To authenticate, include your API key in the `X-Sim-Api-Key` header for every request.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --header "X-Sim-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS.
Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
API requests without authentication will also fail.

<Note>
Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure.
Do not share your secret API keys in public places like GitHub, client-side code, and so on.
</Note>

## Your First Request

Let's make your first request. We'll retrieve token balances for `0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045` (Vitalik's wallet) across multiple EVM chains using the [Balances API](/evm/balances).

Here's how to make the API call:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045" \
     -H "X-Sim-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const options = {method: 'GET', headers: {'X-Sim-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'}};

fetch('https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"

headers = {"X-Sim-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the Sim Dashboard.
</Note>

The API will return a JSON response containing an array of `balances`.
Each object in the array represents a token balance for the specified address on one of the chains, including various details.

```json Response (JSON) [expandable]
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "address": "native",
      "amount": "605371497350928252303",
      "chain": "ethereum",
      "decimals": 18,
      "price_usd": 3042.816964922323,
      "symbol": "ETH",
      "value_usd": 1842034.6622198338
    }
  ],
  "next_offset": "dKMBWDLqM7vlyn5OMEXsLWp0nI4AAAABA5JLazNO7x4poVGqUwsgxgqvvIg",
  "request_time": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "response_time": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "wallet_address": "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"
}
```

With a single API request you get normalized, realtime data with enriched metadata and pricing.

## Next Steps

After making your first API call to Sim APIs, you'll either see the JSON response shown above (success!) or you might encounter an error. If you received an error, check out our [Error Handling Guide](/error-handling) for troubleshooting tips and best practices.

If your call was successful, you've seen how easily you can retrieve comprehensive, multichain data. But this is just the beginning of what's possible.
