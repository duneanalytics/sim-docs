sim APIs power wallets and onchain apps with fast, reliable access to real-time blockchain activity and ownership data.
Access data from 60+ chains with a single request.

This guide will help you make your first API call to retrieve multichain token balances for an address.

## Authentication

sim APIs use API keys to authenticate requests.
You can create and manage your API keys in your [sim Dashboard](https://dune.com/settings/api).

<Frame caption="To generate a new API key, visit Settings -> API -> create new API key.">
  <img src="/images/get-dune-api-key.png" />
</Frame>

To authenticate, include your API key in the `X-Dune-Api-Key` header for every request.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --header "X-Dune-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS.
Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
API requests without authentication will also fail.

<Note>
Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure.
Do not share your secret API keys in public places like GitHub, client-side code, and so on.
</Note>

## Your First Request

Let's make your first request. We'll retrieve token balances for `0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045` (Vitalik's wallet) across multiple EVM chains using the [Token Balances](/evm/balances) endpoint.

Here's how to make the API call:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045" \
     -H "X-Dune-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const options = {method: 'GET', headers: {'X-Dune-Api-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'}};

fetch('https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.sim.dune.com/v1/evm/balances/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"

headers = {"X-Dune-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the sim Dashboard.
</Note>

The API will return a JSON response containing an array of `balances`.
Each object in the array represents a token balance for the specified address on one of the chains, including various details.

```json Response (JSON) [expandable]
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "address": "native",
      "amount": "605371497350928252303",
      "chain": "ethereum",
      "decimals": 18,
      "price_usd": 3042.816964922323,
      "symbol": "ETH",
      "value_usd": 1842034.6622198338
    }
  ],
  "next_offset": "dKMBWDLqM7vlyn5OMEXsLWp0nI4AAAABA5JLazNO7x4poVGqUwsgxgqvvIg",
  "request_time": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "response_time": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "wallet_address": "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"
}
```

With a single API request you get normalized, realtime data with enriched metadata and pricing.
