description: Learn how to set up a Cloudflare Worker to securely proxy your Sim API requests, protecting your API key from client-side exposure.
---

Protect your Sim API key when making requests from client-side apps by using a Cloudflare Worker as a proxy.
This worker receives requests from you app, securely adds your `SIM_API_KEY` on the server, and then forwards the requests to the Sim API endpoints.

We provide a one-click-deploy Cloudflare Worker to simplify this setup.
