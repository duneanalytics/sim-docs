Echo can be used either on the backend or directly from the frontend. If integrating Echo from the frontend, you might want to consider using a Proxy to protect your API key.

We've created this repository that trivially deploys to Cloudflare Workers to help you get started: https://github.com/duneanalytics/echo-proxy

Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform that allows you to deploy your code to a global network of data centers, and is perfect for this use case. It offers 100k invocations per day for free.
