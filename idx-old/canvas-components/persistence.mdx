# Summary

The Persistence component defines a table to persist data from a schema. Tables can be queried and used as a backend for APIs.

# Inputs

1. **Table name:** Enter a table name, which must be unique per org.

# Interactions

Using the three-dot menu, you can delete or duplicate a persistence component. Deleting a persistence will delete the table and its data.

After being connected to a schema, the persistence can be set.

# Allowed edges

## Incoming

* Schema. A persistence is used to persist data from a schema.

## Outgoing

* API (optional): In APIs (and queries), you can query against any table from your org, as well as all @sim core tables, regardless of the canvases in which they were created. In some cases where we're querying a persistence we created in the same canvas, we like to add an edge between the two to make the data origin clear, but these edges are purely cosmetic.
