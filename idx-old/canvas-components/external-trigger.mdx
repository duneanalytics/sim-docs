# Summary

The `External trigger` component creates an endpoint that can be hit externally in order to kick-off execution of a `Canvas`. Data can be passed to the `Canvas` in the body of the request.

Once saved, the component's associated details will be available:

# Inputs

1. **Path:** The path that needs to be included in requests to the external trigger endpoint in order to kick off this specific flow in the `Canvas`.
2. **Fields**A list of fields that can be passed in requests to the external trigger endpoint and whose values will be available in the `env` object of the `EVM Lambda` that executes as a result of the request. 

# Interactions

Using the three-dot menu, you can delete or duplicate an `External Trigger` component. You can also copy a `cURL` request to your external trigger endpoint for testing.

Using the toggle, an `External Trigger` can be disabled/enabled.

# Sync or async

When you call the API for your External Trigger, you must pass one of two`call_type` parameters:

* `sync`(default): The results of the execution are returned in the response to your call to the external trigger.
* `async`: The results of the execution are piped downstream through schemas to any persistence, webhook, or schema mirrors.

# Allowed edges

## Incoming

* None

## Outgoing

* `EVM Lambda`: an `External Trigger` must be connected to some `EVM Lambda` component in order to kick-off anything when hit.
