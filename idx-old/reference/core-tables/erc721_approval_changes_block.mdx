> ðŸŸ¦ Block-level table

> For efficiency, we only emit one record per block for each `(token_address, token_id)` pair. If there are 2+ changes for the same pair in a given block, we emit the last one. This more efficiently serves queries where you want to know state after a given block, but precludes queries that need intra-block (i.e., transaction-level) state.

# Source

This table was built in sim's [ERC721 Owner Changes Block canvas](https://studio.sim.io/canvases/8adb9c94-e6c7-403a-99e1-4355c8c1dfaf).

# Usage notes

There are two types of approvals for ERC721:

1. `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)` grants permission to a single address to transfer a specific NFT, identified by its ID. Approve records will have `is_for_all = false` and the details of the approval specified in `token_id` and `approved_address`. The two remaining columns, `operator` and `approved`, take default values and should be disregarded for this case.
2. `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)` grants or revokes permission to an operator address to manage all of the caller's NFTs. In this case, `is_for_all = true` and the operator is defined in `operator`. If `approved = true` then the record corresponds to the granting of an approval. If `approved = false`, the record corresponds to the removal of an approval.

This column contains two composite index columns to improve performance for queries:

1. `token_address_owner_hash` is the keccak256 hash `(token_address, owner)`. Use in queries where you would otherwise filter on `(token_address, owner)`.
2. `token_address_id_hash` is the keccak256 hash `(token_address, token_id)`. Use in queries where you would otherwise filter on `(token_address, token_id)`.
