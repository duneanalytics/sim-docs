> For efficiency, we only emit one record per block for each `(token_address, account_address)` pair. If there are 2+ changes for the same pair in a given block, we emit the last one. This more efficiently serves queries where you want to know state after a given block, but precludes queries that need intra-block (i.e., transaction-level) state.
