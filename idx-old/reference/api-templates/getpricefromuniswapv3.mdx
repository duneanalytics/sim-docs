# Parameters

1. `token_A` (address as hex string, default: 0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52)
   1. The token that we want to price.
2. `token_B`(address as hex string, default: 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7)
   1. The token in which we want the price to be denominated in. For USD, use USDT or USDC.
3. `block_number` (int, default: 0)
   1. If you want the price quote at a particular block height, input that height here (and also choose a specific `chain_id`). For the latest price, use the default 0.

# Returns

1. `a_to_weth_ts` (timestamp)
   1. This is the timestamp of the swap between tokenA and weth that was used to generate the price.
2. `weth_to_b_ts` (timestamp)
   1. This is the timestamp of the swap between weth and tokenB that was used to generate the price.
3. `a_price_in_b` (decimal)
   1. The price of tokenA in units of tokenB.
