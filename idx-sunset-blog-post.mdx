# Sunsetting Sim IDX: Focusing Our Efforts on the Sim API

*By Mats Hauken, CTO*

Today, I'm writing to share that we've made the difficult decision to sunset Sim IDX, with the beta environment being discontinued on December 31, 2024. Throughout the beta, we've been incredibly grateful for the engagement, feedback, and trust our users have shown. Your input has been invaluable in helping us understand not just what works, but also the structural limitations we've encountered. One of the key factors behind this decision is that our current stack faces challenges that would prevent Sim IDX from expanding to additional chains in the foreseeable future. Rather than investing in workarounds that wouldn't meet the high standards we set for ourselves, we've decided to focus our resources where we can deliver the most value.

We're doubling down on the Sim API, which we believe is the better path forward to serve the developer community with more accurate, consistent, and chain-comprehensive data. The Sim API will continue to evolve and expand, building on what we've learned from Sim IDX while avoiding the limitations that held it back. We recognize that this transition means there won't be a direct replacement for Sim IDX use cases, and we know many of you have invested significant effort into building on the platform.

Our team is committed to supporting you through this migration. Whether you're considering alternatives like Ponder or The Graph's subgraphs, or exploring other options, we're here to help answer questions and provide guidance as you transition. Thank you for partnering with us during the beta—your contributions have shaped our understanding of what developers need, and that insight will continue to inform how we build products at Dune.
