Deploying publishes your app on Sim's managed infrastructure so it can continuously index data and serve production-ready APIs. This guide shows how to connect a local project to GitHub, import it into the Sim dashboard and trigger the first build.

<Info>
Before you continue, complete the [Quickstart](/idx) to install the Sim CLI and initialise an app.

## Create GitHub repo

</Frame>

Open GitHub and [create a new repository](https://github.com/new) named after the folder that contains your project.
In the Quickstart we used `my-first-idx-app`.

## Push app to GitHub

When you ran `sim init`, besides initializing your app, the CLI created a Git repository and committed the first version of your code.
Point the repo at GitHub and push the commit.

</Frame>

Copy the code snippet from GitHub for pushing a code snippet from the command line.
It should look like the following:

```bash
# inside your project folder
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-first-idx-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Import repo

<Note>If you don't have access to IDX tab in the Sim dashboard yet, click Request Access to get enabled.</Note>

Open the Sim dashboard at [sim.dune.com](https://sim.dune.com), select IDX in the sidebar and click Import Repo.
The first time you do this you will have to install the Dune Sim GitHub App.

## Install GitHub App

<Frame caption="Select where to install the GitHub App">

</Frame>

Choose the GitHub account, select allow all or only the repositories you need and click Install.
After installation you return to the import screen and pick your repo.

## Configure & deploy

<Frame caption="Review app settings and deploy">

</Frame>

Review the settings for the App name, the optional description, then press Deploy.
The dashboard will show the deployment with status Pending.

## Monitor deployment progress

</Frame>

Return to the [Sim dashboard](https://sim.dune.com/), click on your app in the IDX tab and watch the new deployment move from **Building → Ingesting → Ready**.
Once the status shows **Ingesting**, your APIs and database are live and serving data.

## Next steps

Your first build is now running. Head over to the [App Page](/idx/app-page) to learn where to find the database connection string, generated API endpoints and deployment status.
