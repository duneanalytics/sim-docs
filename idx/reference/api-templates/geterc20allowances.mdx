# Parameters

1. `address` (address as hex string, default: 0x000e7be03f9adbc5065396a09e1b6ddc9da5a8bf)
2. `chain_id` (uint64, default: 0)
   1. Optional. Can be used to view balances from a certain chain. If unset, defaults to `0` and returns results from all chains.
3. `token_address` (address as hex string, default: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
   1. Optional. Can be used to filter results to a specific token. If unset, defaults to `address(0)` and all tokens are checked.
4. `block_number` (uint64, default: 0)
   1. Optional. Can be used to view allowances at a particular block. If unset, defaults to `0` and returns latest.
5. `limit` (uint32, default: 100)
   1. Number of records you want returned.
6. `offset` (uint32, default: 0)
   1. For pagination. If you're showing ten records per page, choose offset = 9 for the second page.

# Returns

Array with the following fields (in descending order of `block_last_changed`):

1. `chain_id` (int64)
   1. The chain for the token
2. `token_address` (address as hex string)
   1. The address of the token.
3. `token_name` (string)
   1. The name of the token.
4. `token_symbol` (string)
   1. The symbol of the token.
5. `spender` (address as hex string)
   1. The address that is permitted to spend
6. `allowance` (int256 as decimal string)
   1. The amount of the allowance normalized by token\_decimals. Note that many contracts treat the max value of uint256 (\~1.1579Ã—10^77) as an unlimited allowance that doesn't decrement when the spender uses it.
7. `txn_last_changed` (address as hex string)
   1. The most recent transaction that impacted the balance.
8. `block_last_changed` (int64)
   1. The most recent block that impacted the balance.
