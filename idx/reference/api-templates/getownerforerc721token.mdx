# Query

```sql
SELECT b.owner
FROM @sim.erc721_owner_changes_block b
WHERE b.token_address = lower($token_address)
  AND b.chain_id = $chain_id
  AND b.token_id = $token_id
  AND b.block_number IN (
    SELECT MAX(block_number) AS latest_block_number
    FROM @sim.erc721_owner_changes_block
    WHERE token_address = lower($token_address)
      AND chain_id = $chain_id  
      AND token_id = $token_id
      AND (
        block_number <= $block_number
