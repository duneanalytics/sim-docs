title: DB Inspection
---

After deploying your Sim IDX application with `sim deploy`, the framework automatically provisions a dedicated PostgreSQL database to store your indexed onchain data.
The deployment output provides you with a read-only connection string to access this database directly.

You can use this during development to verify your schema, inspect live data, and create queries while building your API.

<Note>
The database connection string provided after deployment is intended for development and debugging.
Your deployed API will connect to a separate, production-ready database instance with the same schema.
</Note>

## Connecting to Your Database

Use the database connection string from the `sim deploy` output to connect with any standard PostgreSQL client.

```
db_read_connection: "postgres://username:password@host/database?sslmode=require"
```

For example, using `psql`:

```bash
# Connect using the full connection string
psql "your_connection_string_here"
```

<Info>
You can also use clients ike DBeaver, Postico, or Beekeeper Studio for a more visual way to explore your data and schema.

## Understanding the Schema

The structure of your database is directly determined by the `event` definitions in your `Listener.sol` contract.

*   **Tables**: Each `event` in your listener creates a corresponding table in the database. The table name is the `snake_case` version of the event's `PascalCase` name.
*   **Columns**: The parameters of the event become the columns of the table.

An event defined as `event PoolCreated(address pool, address token0, address token1)` will result in a table named `pool_created` with the columns `pool`, `token0`, and `token1`.

When you list tables in your database, you will see tables corresponding to your events, as well as some internal tables with random character suffixes (e.g., `poolcreated_X3rbm4nC`). **You should only query the clean, snake_cased table names.**

## Common Database Operations

Here are some common `psql` commands you can use to inspect your database:

| Operation              | `psql` Command                             | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **List Tables**        | `\dt`                                      | Shows all queryable tables in the public schema.                          |
| **Describe Table**     | `\d "table_name"`                          | Displays the columns, types, and indexes for a specific table.            |
| **View Sample Data**   | `SELECT * FROM "table_name" LIMIT 10;`     | Retrieves the first 10 rows from a table.                                 |
| **Count Rows**         | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "table_name";`       | Counts the total number of records indexed in a table.                    |
