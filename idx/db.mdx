title: DB Inspection
---

After deploying your Sim IDX app, the framework automatically provisions a dedicated PostgreSQL database to store your indexed on-chain data.
The deployment output provides you with a read-only connection string to access this database directly.

You can use this during development to verify your schema, inspect live data, and create queries while building your API.

<Note>
The database connection string provided after deployment is intended for development and debugging.
Your deployed API will connect to a separate, production-ready database instance with the same schema.
</Note>

## Connecting to Your Database

Use the [database connection string](/idx/app-page#db-connection) provided in your app's deployment to connect with any standard PostgreSQL client.

```
db_read_connection: "postgres://username:password@host/database?sslmode=require"
```

For example, using `psql`:

```bash
# Connect using the full connection string
psql "your_connection_string_here"
```

You can also use clients ike DBeaver, Postico, or Beekeeper Studio for a more visual way to explore your data and schema.

## Understanding the Schema

The structure of your database is directly determined by the `event` definitions in your `Main.sol` contract.

*   **Views**: Each `event` in your listener creates a corresponding queryable view in the database. The view name is the lowercase `snake_case` version of the event name.
*   **Columns**: The parameters of the event become the columns of the view, and each column name is converted to lowercase `snake_case`.
*   **Tables**: The underlying tables that store the data have random character suffixes (e.g., `pool_created_X3rbm4nC`) and should not be queried directly.

An event defined as `event PoolCreated(address pool, address token0, address token1)` will result in a queryable view named `pool_created` with the columns `pool`, `token0`, and `token1`.

When you inspect your database, you will see both the clean views you should query and the internal tables with random suffixes. **Always query the views (lowercase `snake_case` names).**

## Limitations

Currently, Sim IDX only supports creating new rows in the database, not updates to existing rows. This means that once data is indexed and stored, it cannot be modified through the framework. We are exploring options to support updates in future versions.

## Common Database Operations

Here are some common `psql` commands you can use to inspect your database:

| Operation              | `psql` Command                             | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **List Views**         | `\dv`                                       | Shows all queryable views in the public schema.                          |
| **Describe View**      | `\d "view_name"`                           | Displays the columns, types, and structure for a specific view.           |
| **View Sample Data**   | `SELECT * FROM "view_name" LIMIT 10;`      | Retrieves the first 10 rows from a view.                                  |
| **Count Rows**         | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "view_name";`        | Counts the total number of records indexed in a view.                     |
