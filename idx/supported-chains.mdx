IDX is a multi-chain indexing platform that lets you to build apps across multiple blockchain networks simultaneously.
You can choose to build on a single blockchain, or build real-time apps that span across any combination of the supported networks below.

<Note>
  IDX support for additional chains is continuously expanding. If you need support for a specific chain that's not listed here, please reach out to our team through the [support channels](/support).
</Note>

## Available Chains

We currently support the following blockchain networks. Each card shows the chain's display name, the corresponding enum value for use in your code (`Chains.EnumName`), and the chain ID for direct reference:

<EVMSupportedChains />

For more information on setting up triggers and working with different chains, see the [IDX Framework documentation](/idx/listener).

## Using chainContract in Triggers

To listen to events on any supported chain, use the `chainContract` function with the corresponding chain enum. This function takes a chain enum and contract address to create triggers for specific smart contracts:

```solidity
// Example: Listen to events on Ethereum mainnet
addTrigger(
    chainContract(Chains.Ethereum, 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984), 
    listener.triggerOnPoolCreatedEvent()
);

// Example: Listen to events on Base
addTrigger(
    chainContract(Chains.Base, 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984), 
    listener.triggerOnPoolCreatedEvent()
);

// Example: Multi-chain app listening to the same contract on different chains
addTrigger(
    chainContract(Chains.Arbitrum, 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984), 
    listener.triggerOnPoolCreatedEvent()
);
addTrigger(
    chainContract(Chains.Optimism, 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984), 
    listener.triggerOnPoolCreatedEvent()
);
```

<Note>
If you want to register other types of triggers, like triggering on ABI or triggering globally, visit the [Listener Features page](/idx/listener/features) to learn more.

### Block Range Support

You can specify custom block ranges for your triggers to target specific blocks or time periods. Chain helper functions support `.withStartBlock()`, `.withEndBlock()`, and `.withBlockRange()` methods:

```solidity
// Listen to events starting from a specific block onwards
addTrigger(
    chainContract(Chains.Ethereum.withStartBlock(10000000), 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984), 
    listener.triggerOnPoolCreatedEvent()
);

// Listen to events within a specific block range (inclusive)
addTrigger(
    chainContract(Chains.Base.withStartBlock(5000000).withEndBlock(5000100), 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984), 
    listener.triggerOnPoolCreatedEvent()
);
```

Block ranges are particularly useful for historical data analysis, testing specific time periods, or limiting triggers to certain blockchain events.

## Testing with Chain-Specific Evaluation

When developing and testing your IDX app, you can use the `sim listeners evaluate` command with the `--chain-id` parameter to test your listeners on specific chains:

```bash
# Test listeners on Ethereum mainnet only
sim listeners evaluate --chain-id 1

# Test listeners on Base only  
sim listeners evaluate --chain-id 8453

# Test listeners on Arbitrum only
sim listeners evaluate --chain-id 42161
```

If you omit the `--chain-id` parameter, the evaluation will run across all chains that your triggers are configured for:

```bash
# Test listeners on all configured chains
sim listeners evaluate
```

<Note>
To learn more about the `sim listeners evaluate` command, visit the [CLI documentation](/idx/cli#sim-listeners-evaluate) page to learn more.
