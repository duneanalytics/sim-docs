title: Deployment Environments
---

Sim IDX streamlines your development and deployment lifecycle by integrating directly with your Git branching strategy.
This allows you to build, test, and ship changes using isolated environments.

Every Sim IDX app operates in one of two environments: **Production** or **Preview**.

## Production Environment

When you push a new commit to the `main` branch of your connected repo, a new production deployment is automatically created.

A new, dedicated PostgreSQL database is provisioned for every deployment.
A new base URL for your APIs is also created.

<Note>
If you're using these values during development, make sure you update them after every push.

## Preview Environments

When you push a new commit to any branch that _is not_ `main`, Sim IDX automatically spins up a completely separate environment for it.
Each preview deployment will get its own isolated database and unique API URL.
