title: Deployment Environments
---

Sim IDX streamlines your development and deployment lifecycle by integrating directly with your Git branching strategy.
This allows you to build, test, and ship changes using isolated environments.

Every Sim IDX app operates in one of two environments: **Production** or **Preview**.

## Production Environment

When you push a new commit to the `main` branch of your connected repo, a new production deployment is automatically created.

A new, dedicated PostgreSQL database is provisioned for every deployment.
A new base URL for your APIs is also created.

<Note>
If you're using these values during development, make sure you update them after every push.

## Preview Environments

When you push a new commit to any branch that _is not_ `main`, Sim IDX automatically spins up a completely separate environment for it.
Each preview deployment will get its own isolated database and unique API URL.

## PR Flow

For a more structured development process, you can use PRs on GitHub to trigger preview deployments.
This allows for code review and collaborative testing before merging changes into the `main` branch.

To start, create a new branch in your local repo and push it to GitHub.
Then, open a pull request from your new branch to the `main` branch.

</Frame>

Once the pull request is created, Sim IDX automatically builds a new preview deployment.
You can find this build in the "Other Deployments" section of your App Page in the Sim dashboard.

The deployment is linked to the pull request, allowing you and your team to easily access the PR on GitHub to review changes and test the isolated deployment.

After the pull request is approved and merged, a new production deployment will be created from the `main` branch.
