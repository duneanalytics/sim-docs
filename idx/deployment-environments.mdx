title: Deployment Environments
---

Sim IDX streamlines your development and deployment lifecycle by integrating directly with your Git branching strategy.
This allows you to build, test, and ship changes using isolated environments.

Every Sim IDX app operates in one of two environments: **Production** or **Preview**.

## Production Environment

When you push a new commit to the `main` branch of your connected repo, a new production deployment is automatically created.

A fresh, dedicated PostgreSQL database is provisioned for every production deployment.
A new base URL for your APIs is created.

<Note>
A new base URL and DB connection string are created every time, so make sure you update it anywhere you're using them during development.

## Preview Environments

When you push a commit to a new branch that's not main, Sim IDX automatically spins up a completely separate environment for it.
Similarly to the production deployment, each one will get its own isolated database and unique API url.
