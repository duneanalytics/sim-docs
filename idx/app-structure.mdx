```

Running `sim init` creates a new Sim IDX app with the folder structure shown above.
The following sections explain each folder's purpose and contents in detail.

## App Folder Structure

#### sim.toml

The `sim.toml` file is your app's main configuration file. It contains your app's `name` and a `[listeners]` table for configuring code generation.

```toml
[app]
name = "my-test"
```

The `name` field is used internally by Sim IDX for resource naming and deployment.

```toml
[listeners]
codegen_naming_convention = "plain"
```

The `codegen_naming_convention` field in the `[listeners]` table controls how function and type names are generated from your ABIs. This manages potential name conflicts when you index multiple contracts. It supports two values:

*   **`"plain"` (Default):** Generates clean names without any prefixes (e.g., `onSwapFunction`). This is the most common setting, especially when you split logic for different ABIs into separate listener contracts.
*   **`"abi_prefix"`:** Prefixes generated names with the ABI's name (e.g., `ABI1$onSwapFunction`). Use this option to prevent compilation errors when a single listener contract must handle functions with the same name from two different ABIs.

#### abis/

The `abis/` folder contains JSON ABI files of smart contracts you want to index. The sample app includes `abis/UniswapV3Factory.json` for the Uniswap V3 Factory contract.

<Note>
When you add a new ABI with the [`sim abi add`](/idx/cli#sim-abi-add-<file-path>) CLI command, it automatically generates Solidity bindings in `listeners/lib/sim-idx-generated/`.
</Note>

#### apis/

The `apis/` folder is a complete Node.js project that provides TypeScript API endpoints running on the Cloudflare Workers Edge runtime.

The `src/index.ts` file defines your HTTP routes, while `src/db/schema/Listener.ts` is produced by `sim build` and exposes your listener-generated tables through Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries.

</Columns>

#### listeners/

The `listeners/` folder is a Foundry project that contains everything related to on-chain indexing. The `Triggers` contract must be defined in `src/Main.sol`, but handler logic can be implemented in one or more listener contracts, which can have any name and be defined across multiple `.sol` files in the `src/` directory. **Unit tests live under the `test/` directory. Foundry will discover any file ending in `.t.sol`, so you can add as many unit-test files as you need (e.g., `Main.t.sol`, `SwapHandlers.t.sol`, etc.).**

During `sim build`, the framework inserts core helpers into `lib/sim-idx-sol/` and writes ABI-specific bindings into `lib/sim-idx-generated/`. These generated files should not be edited directly.

## Development Workflow

Here's how these folders work together:

1.  **Add Contract ABI** → `abis/YourContract.json`
2.  **Generate Bindings** → `sim abi add` creates Solidity bindings
3.  **Extend Listener** → Implement handlers in `listeners/src/`
4.  **Test Logic** → Write tests in `listeners/test/` (e.g., any `*.t.sol` files)
5.  **Build APIs** → Use generated schema in `apis/src/` to query your data
6.  **Deploy** → Push your changes to a branch (or `main`) and follow the steps in the [deployment guide](/idx/deployment) to promote them to a live environment
