title: API Development
---

With your onchain data indexed and stored in a PostgreSQL database, the final step is to build an API to serve it.
Sim IDX provides a serverless TypeScript environment with **Cloudflare Workers**, allowing you to build and deploy fast, scalable APIs with minimal configuration.

The boilerplate API in the `apis/` directory uses **Hono** as a lightweight web framework and **Drizzle** as a type-safe ORM for database queries.

## Local Development Setup

Before deploying, you can run and test your API locally.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the API directory">
    ```bash
    cd apis
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Environment Variable">
    Create a file named `.dev.vars` in the `apis/` directory. Add the database connection string you received from `sim deploy` to this file.

    ```plaintext .dev.vars
    DB_CONNECTION_STRING="your_database_connection_string_from_sim_deploy"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your API is now running locally at `http://localhost:8787`.
  </Step>

## Understanding the API Code

The boilerplate API in `apis/src/index.ts` is a TypeScript application that runs on Cloudflare Workers. It connects to your indexed database and exposes HTTP endpoints to query your data. Let's understand how this works:

### Framework Setup

The API uses the `sim-idx` helper library, which wraps **Hono** and **Drizzle** to simplify setup:
```typescript
import { App, db, types } from "sim-idx";
import { eq, sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import { poolCreated, ownerQueried } from "./db/schema/Listener";
```

**Hono** handles HTTP requests and routing, while **Drizzle** provides a type-safe way to query your PostgreSQL database.

### Environment Configuration

`sim-idx` handles database credentials for you in both local development and deployed environments, so no additional environment variables are required.

### Application Instance

Create the web application with a single call:
```typescript
const app = App.create();
```

### Database Connection Management

Instead of managing your own connection pool, call `db.client(c)` inside a request handler to reuse the shared Drizzle client:
```typescript
const rows = await db.client(c)
  .select()
  .from(poolCreated)
  .limit(10);
```

## Adding a New Endpoint

Let's build three endpoints to serve our indexed data:
- `/api/pools` - Get recent Uniswap V3 pools
- `/api/owner-queries` - Get recent owner queries
- `/api/pools/count` - Get total number of pools

### Creating the Pools Endpoint

Let's create our first endpoint to fetch the 10 most recent Uniswap V3 pools. This endpoint will query the `pool_created` table we created in our listener:

```typescript
// Endpoint to get the 10 most recent Uniswap V3 pools
app.get("/api/pools", async (c) => {
  try {
    const rows = await db.client(c)
      .select()
      .from(poolCreated)
      .limit(10);

    return Response.json({ data: rows });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Database operation failed:", e);
    return Response.json({ error: (e as Error).message }, { status: 500 });
  }
});
```

This endpoint uses a simple SQL query to fetch the most recent pools. The `LIMIT 10` clause ensures we don't return too much data at once. In a production environment, you might want to add pagination and filtering options.

### Adding the Owner Queries Endpoint

Now let's add an endpoint to fetch the 10 most recent owner queries. This will query the `owner_queried` table:

```typescript
// Endpoint to get the 10 most recent owner queries
app.get("/api/owner-queries", async (c) => {
  try {
    const rows = await db.client(c)
      .select()
      .from(ownerQueried)
      .limit(10);

    return Response.json({ data: rows });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Database operation failed:", e);
    return Response.json({ error: (e as Error).message }, { status: 500 });
  }
});
```

This endpoint follows the same pattern as the pools endpoint, but queries a different table. Both endpoints include error handling to ensure graceful failure if something goes wrong.

### Creating the Pool Count Endpoint

Finally, let's add an endpoint to get the total number of pools. This will be useful for pagination and analytics:

```typescript
// Endpoint to get the total number of pools
app.get("/api/pools/count", async (c) => {
  try {
    const [{ total }] = await db.client(c)
      .select({ total: sql<number>`COUNT(*)` })
      .from(poolCreated);

    return Response.json({ data: total });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Database operation failed:", e);
    return Response.json({ error: (e as Error).message }, { status: 500 });
  }
});
```

This endpoint uses an aggregate query to efficiently count pools without fetching every row.

### Testing Your Endpoints

After adding all three endpoints, you can test them locally:

- `http://localhost:8787/api/pools` - Get recent pools
- `http://localhost:8787/api/owner-queries` - Get recent owner queries
- `http://localhost:8787/api/pools/count` - Get total pool count

## Deploying Your API

    Haven't connected your GitHub repo to Sim yet? Follow the App Deployment guide to link your project and trigger the first build.
  </Card>
</Columns>

Once your repository is connected, shipping updates is as simple as pushing code:

- Push commits to the `main` branch to roll out a new **production** deployment.
- Push to any other branch to spin up a **preview** deployment with its own URL â€” perfect for staging and pull-request reviews.

Sim IDX automatically builds your Cloudflare Worker and updates the deployment status in the dashboard. No CLI command is required.
