title: API Development
---

Sim IDX provides a complete serverless API development environment with built-in database connectivity, automatic scaling, and edge deployment.
Whether you're building simple data endpoints or advanced features, the platform handles infrastructure concerns so you can focus on your business logic.

This guide walks you through the complete API development lifecycle on the platform.

## Infrastructure & Scalability

Your API runs on **Cloudflare Workers** with the **Hono** framework.
Anything you can do in Hono will also work here.
Your data is stored in a **Neon** Postgres accessed through Cloudflare **Hyperdrive**.
Requests execute at the edge close to users, and database connections are pooled automatically, so you don’t have to manage servers or connection limits.

<Note>
The setup scales with your traffic, but there are sensible platform limits. If you anticipate sustained very high volume, please [contact us](/support) so we can make sure everything runs smoothly.
</Note>

## Local Development Setup

Building APIs on Sim IDX follows a streamlined workflow: develop locally, write endpoints to query your indexed data, and deploy with a simple git push.
The boilerplate API in the `apis/` directory gives you a starting point with common patterns for querying your indexed blockchain data and serving it through HTTP endpoints.

Before deploying, you can run and test your API locally.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the API directory">
    ```bash
    cd apis
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Environment Variable">
    Create a file named `.dev.vars` in the `apis/` directory. Add the database connection string you can find on the [App Page](/idx/app-page#dbconnection) after deploying your app.

    ```plaintext .dev.vars
    DB_CONNECTION_STRING="your_database_connection_string_from_app_page"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your API is now running locally at `http://localhost:8787`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understand the API Code

The boilerplate API in `apis/src/index.ts` is a TypeScript application that runs on Cloudflare Workers. It connects to your indexed database and exposes HTTP endpoints to query your data. Let's understand how this works:

### Framework Setup

The API uses the `sim-idx` helper library, which wraps **Hono** and **Drizzle** to simplify setup:
```typescript
import { App, db, types } from "sim-idx";
import { eq, sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import { poolCreated, ownerQueried } from "./db/schema/Listener";
```

**Hono** handles HTTP requests and routing, while **Drizzle** provides a type-safe way to query your PostgreSQL database.

### Environment Configuration

`sim-idx` handles database credentials for you in both local development and deployed environments, so no additional environment variables are required.

### Application Instance

Create the web application with a single call:
```typescript
const app = App.create();
```

### Database Connection Management

Instead of managing your own connection pool, call `db.client(c)` inside a request handler to reuse the shared Drizzle client:
```typescript
const rows = await db.client(c)
  .select()
  .from(poolCreated)
  .limit(10);
```

## Add a New Endpoint

Let's build three endpoints to serve our indexed data:
- `/api/pools` - Get recent Uniswap V3 pools
- `/api/owner-changed` - Get recent owner changed events
- `/api/pools/count` - Get total number of pools

### Creating the Pools Endpoint

Let's create our first endpoint to fetch the 10 most recent Uniswap V3 pools. This endpoint will query the `pool_created` table we created in our listener:

```typescript
// Endpoint to get the 10 most recent Uniswap V3 pools
app.get("/api/pools", async (c) => {
  try {
    const rows = await db.client(c)
      .select()
      .from(poolCreated)
      .limit(10);

    return Response.json({ data: rows });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Database operation failed:", e);
    return Response.json({ error: (e as Error).message }, { status: 500 });
  }
});
```

This endpoint uses a simple SQL query to fetch the most recent pools. The `LIMIT 10` clause ensures we don't return too much data at once. In a production environment, you might want to add pagination and filtering options.

### Adding the Owner Changed Endpoint

<Note>
Before continuing, make sure you've added support for the `OwnerChanged` event in your listener contract by following the ["Hooking into more functions and events"](/idx/listener#hooking-into-more-functions-and-events) section of the Listener guide and then running:

```bash
sim build
```

Running `sim build` regenerates `apis/src/db/schema/Listener.ts` with a new `ownerChanged` table binding that we import below.
</Note>

Now let's add an endpoint to fetch the 10 most recent owner changed events. This will query the `owner_changed` table:

```typescript
// Endpoint to get the 10 most recent owner changed events
app.get("/api/owner-changed", async (c) => {
  try {
    const rows = await db.client(c)
      .select()
      .from(ownerChanged)
      .limit(10);

    return Response.json({ data: rows });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Database operation failed:", e);
    return Response.json({ error: (e as Error).message }, { status: 500 });
  }
});
```

### Creating the Pool Count Endpoint

Finally, let's add an endpoint to get the total number of pools. This will be useful for pagination and analytics:

```typescript
// Endpoint to get the total number of pools
app.get("/api/pools/count", async (c) => {
  try {
    const [{ total }] = await db.client(c)
      .select({ total: sql<number>`COUNT(*)` })
      .from(poolCreated);

    return Response.json({ data: total });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Database operation failed:", e);
    return Response.json({ error: (e as Error).message }, { status: 500 });
  }
});
```

This endpoint uses an aggregate query to efficiently count pools without fetching every row.

### Testing Your Endpoints

After adding all three endpoints, you can test them locally:

- `http://localhost:8787/api/pools` - Get recent pools
- `http://localhost:8787/api/owner-changed` - Get recent owner changed events
- `http://localhost:8787/api/pools/count` - Get total pool count

## Deploy Your API

    Haven't connected your GitHub repo to Sim yet? Follow the App Deployment guide to link your project and trigger the first build.

Once your repository is connected, shipping updates is as simple as pushing code:

- Push commits to the `main` branch to roll out a new **production** deployment.
- Push to any other branch to spin up a **preview** deployment with its own URL — perfect for staging and pull-request reviews.

Sim IDX automatically builds your Cloudflare Worker and updates the deployment status in the dashboard. No CLI command is required.
