title: API Development
---

With your onchain data indexed and stored in a PostgreSQL database, the final step is to build an API to serve it.
Sim IDX provides a serverless TypeScript environment with **Cloudflare Workers**, allowing you to build and deploy fast, scalable APIs with minimal configuration.

The boilerplate API in the `apis/` directory uses **Hono** as a lightweight web framework and **Drizzle** as a type-safe ORM for database queries.

## Local Development Setup

Before deploying, you can run and test your API locally.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the API directory">
    ```bash
    cd apis
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Environment Variable">
    Create a file named `.dev.vars` in the `apis/` directory. Add the database connection string you received from `sim deploy` to this file.

    ```plaintext .dev.vars
    DB_CONNECTION_STRING="your_database_connection_string_from_sim_deploy"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your API is now running locally at `http://localhost:8787`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the API Code

The boilerplate API in `apis/src/index.ts` is a TypeScript application that runs on Cloudflare Workers. It connects to your indexed database and exposes HTTP endpoints to query your data. Let's understand how this works:

### Framework Setup

The API uses **Hono**, a lightweight web framework perfect for edge computing:
```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/neon-http";
```

**Hono** handles HTTP requests and routing, while **Drizzle** provides a type-safe way to query your PostgreSQL database.

### Environment Configuration

The API expects your database connection string as an environment variable:
```typescript
type Bindings = {
  DB_CONNECTION_STRING: string;
};
```

This type definition ensures TypeScript knows what environment variables are available and provides autocomplete support.

### Application Instance

The Hono app is initialized with type bindings for environment variables:
```typescript
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();
```

This creates your web application instance that will handle incoming HTTP requests.

### Database Connection Management

A shared database client improves performance by reusing connections:
```typescript
let dbClient: ReturnType<typeof drizzle>;

async function getDBClient(env: Bindings) {
  if (!dbClient) {
    dbClient = drizzle(env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING);
  }
  return dbClient;
}
```

This pattern creates one database connection that's reused across all requests, rather than creating a new connection for each API call.

## Adding a New Endpoint

Let's build three endpoints to serve our indexed data:
- `/api/pools` - Get recent Uniswap V3 pools
- `/api/owner-queries` - Get recent owner queries
- `/api/pools/count` - Get total number of pools

### Creating the Pools Endpoint

Let's create our first endpoint to fetch the 10 most recent Uniswap V3 pools. This endpoint will query the `pool_created` table we created in our listener:

```typescript
// Endpoint to get the 10 most recent Uniswap V3 pools
app.get("/api/pools", async (c) => {
  try {
    const client = await getDBClient(c.env);
    // Note: Drizzle's execute is used for raw SQL. For full type-safety, define a Drizzle schema.
    const result = await client.execute('SELECT * FROM pool_created LIMIT 10');
    return Response.json({
      data: result.rows,
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Database operation failed:", e);
    return Response.json({ error: (e as Error).message }, { status: 500 });
  }
});
```

This endpoint uses a simple SQL query to fetch the most recent pools. The `LIMIT 10` clause ensures we don't return too much data at once. In a production environment, you might want to add pagination and filtering options.

### Adding the Owner Queries Endpoint

Now let's add an endpoint to fetch the 10 most recent owner queries. This will query the `owner_queried` table:

```typescript
// Endpoint to get the 10 most recent owner queries
app.get("/api/owner-queries", async (c) => {
  try {
    const client = await getDBClient(c.env);
    const result = await client.execute('SELECT * FROM owner_queried LIMIT 10');
    return Response.json({
      data: result.rows,
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Database operation failed:", e);
    return Response.json({ error: (e as Error).message }, { status: 500 });
  }
});
```

This endpoint follows the same pattern as the pools endpoint, but queries a different table. Both endpoints include error handling to ensure graceful failure if something goes wrong.

### Creating the Pool Count Endpoint

Finally, let's add an endpoint to get the total number of pools. This will be useful for pagination and analytics:

```typescript
// Endpoint to get the total number of pools
app.get("/api/pools/count", async (c) => {
  try {
    const client = await getDBClient(c.env);
    const result = await client.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM pool_created');
    return Response.json({
      data: result.rows[0].total,
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Database operation failed:", e);
    return Response.json({ error: (e as Error).message }, { status: 500 });
  }
});
```

This endpoint uses a `COUNT` query to efficiently get the total number of pools without fetching all the data. The result is returned as a simple number.

### Testing Your Endpoints

After adding all three endpoints, you can test them locally:
- `http://localhost:8787/api/pools` - Get recent pools
- `http://localhost:8787/api/owner-queries` - Get recent owner queries
- `http://localhost:8787/api/pools/count` - Get total pool count

## Deploying Your API

Once you are satisfied with your API, deploy it to the Sim IDX platform using the same command as before:

```bash
sim deploy
```

Sim IDX will bundle and deploy your TypeScript code to Cloudflare's global network. Your updated API will be live at the API URL provided in the deployment output.
