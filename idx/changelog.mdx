<Update label="July 25, 2025" description="CLI v0.0.83">
  **CallFrame Properties Are Now Functions**

  Every field on `ctx.txn.call`’s `CallFrame` structure has been updated to use function calls instead of direct property access.

  **What changed:**

  | Old (≤ v0.0.82)          | New (v0.0.83+)             |
  | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
  | `ctx.txn.call.callee`    | `ctx.txn.call.callee()`    |
  | `ctx.txn.call.caller`    | `ctx.txn.call.caller()`    |
  | `ctx.txn.call.callData`  | `ctx.txn.call.callData()`  |
  | `ctx.txn.call.callDepth` | `ctx.txn.call.callDepth()` |
  | `ctx.txn.call.value`     | `ctx.txn.call.value()`     |
  | `ctx.txn.call.callType`  | `ctx.txn.call.callType()`  |
  | *(new)*                  | `ctx.txn.call.delegator()` |
  | *(new)*                  | `ctx.txn.call.delegatee()` |

  `ctx.txn.call.verificationSource` is unchanged (still a property).

  **Impact:**

  If you were directly reading these fields, your code will no longer compile. Add `()` everywhere you touch `ctx.txn.call.*`.

  ```diff Example (UniswapV3Factory Listener)
  emit PoolCreated(
  -     uint64(block.chainid), ctx.txn.call.callee, outputs.pool, inputs.tokenA, inputs.tokenB, inputs.fee
  +     uint64(block.chainid), ctx.txn.call.callee(), outputs.pool, inputs.tokenA, inputs.tokenB, inputs.fee
  );
  ```

  **New Feature: Database Indexing Support**

  You can now define database indexes directly within your listener contracts. This gives you more control over your app's query performance.

  **What's new:**
  
  - Define indexes directly above your `event` declarations using a `/// @custom:index` comment in your Solidity code.
  - Support for multiple index types, including `BTREE`, `HASH`, `BRIN`, and `GIN`.
  - The `sim build` command now validates your index definitions to catch errors early.

  **Benefits:**

  - **Improved Query Performance**: Significantly speed up data retrieval by indexing columns that are frequently used in your API queries.
  - **Declarative and Convenient**: Manage database performance directly from your Solidity code without writing separate migration scripts.
  - **Fine-Grained Control**: Apply the right index types to the right columns for optimal performance.

  For more details on how to define indexes, see the [Listener Features](/idx/listener/features#db-indexes) documentation.

<Update label="July 16, 2025" description="CLI v0.0.79">
  **Breaking Change: Generated Struct Names Now Include Contract Names**

  With CLI version v0.0.79 and upwards, there will be a breaking change that impacts users who import and use generated structs from the ABI.

  **Why this change was needed:**
  The same struct name can be used across different contracts (example: `GPv2Trade.Data` and `GPv2Interaction.Data` within the same ABI) with different definitions. Using just the struct name for generated structs prevented proper triggering on protocols like CoW Swap.

  **What changed:**
  We now include the contract name as part of the struct name in the generated Solidity file associated with the ABI. Instead of using `$AbiName$StructName` for the names, we now use `$AbiName$ContractName$StructName`.

  **Impact:**
  If you have imported a generated struct, you'll need to update the name to include the contract name the next time you run codegen. This doesn't impact the default inputs/outputs/context structs, so most users won't encounter this issue.

  **Who is affected:**
  You'll only run into this issue if you:
  - Update to use CLI v0.0.79 or higher
  - Add a new ABI or manually run a new codegen
  - AND you've been using generated structs that aren't the ones provided in the trigger inputs/outputs object (i.e., you're using a nested struct from the inputs/outputs for some variable or part of the event)

<Update label="July 15, 2025" description="CLI v0.0.78">
  **New Feature: Multiple Listener Contracts Support**

  The Sim CLI now supports defining multiple listener contracts within a single IDX application, enabling better code organization and structure.

  **What's new:**
  - You can now define listeners in separate files instead of having everything in `Main.sol`
  - Listeners can be organized across multiple contracts for better code maintainability
  - The `Main.sol` file still needs to contain the `Triggers` contract, but individual listeners can be defined anywhere
  - Enhanced `sim listeners evaluate` command to target specific listeners for focused testing

  **Benefits:**
  - **Better Code Organization**: Split large applications with many listeners into manageable, separate files
  - **Improved Maintainability**: Organize related listeners together (e.g., all DEX-specific listeners in one file)
  - **Focused Testing**: Evaluate specific listeners without noise from other listeners in your application

  **Migration:**
  - Existing single-file applications continue to work without changes
  - `Main.sol` must still exist and contain your `Triggers` contract
  - Listener contracts can be moved to separate files as needed

  This feature is particularly valuable for complex applications like DEX trade indexers that may have 15+ listeners and benefit from better file organization.

  **New Feature: Pre-Execution Triggers**

  The Sim CLI now supports pre-execution triggers, allowing you to execute code _before_ a function runs instead of the default behavior of executing after.

  **What's new:**
  - Pre-triggers use corresponding `Pre-` abstract contracts (e.g., `preCreatePoolFunction`)
  - Handlers receive a `PreFunctionContext` with access to function inputs only (outputs haven't been generated yet)
  - Enables reactive logic that needs to run before the target function executes

  **Use cases:**
  - Emit events or perform actions based on upcoming function calls
  - Pre-process or validate function inputs before execution
  - Set up state or conditions that the main function execution will depend on

  For detailed implementation examples and usage patterns, see the [Function Triggers documentation](/idx/listener#function-triggers).
