  **Breaking Change: Generated Struct Names Now Include Contract Names**

  With CLI version v0.0.79 and upwards, there will be a breaking change that impacts users who import and use generated structs from the ABI.

  **Why this change was needed:**
  The same struct name can be used across different contracts (example: `GPv2Trade.Data` and `GPv2Interaction.Data` within the same ABI) with different definitions. Using just the struct name for generated structs prevented proper hooking on protocols like CoW Swap.

  **What changed:**
  We now include the contract name as part of the struct name in the generated Solidity file associated with the ABI. Instead of using `$AbiName$StructName` for the names, we now use `$AbiName$ContractName$StructName`.

  **Impact:**
  If you have imported a generated struct, you'll need to update the name to include the contract name the next time you run codegen. This doesn't impact the default inputs/outputs/context structs, so most users won't encounter this issue.

  **Who is affected:**
  You'll only run into this issue if you:
  - Update to use CLI v0.0.79 or higher
  - Add a new ABI or manually run a new codegen
  - AND you've been using generated structs that aren't the ones provided in the trigger inputs/outputs object (i.e., you're using a nested struct from the inputs/outputs for some variable or part of the event)

  **New Feature: Multiple Listener Contracts Support**

  The Sim CLI now supports defining multiple listener contracts within a single IDX application, enabling better code organization and structure.

  **What's new:**
  - You can now define listeners in separate files instead of having everything in `Main.sol`
  - Listeners can be organized across multiple contracts for better code maintainability
  - The `Main.sol` file still needs to contain the `Triggers` contract, but individual listeners can be defined anywhere
  - Enhanced `sim listeners evaluate` command to target specific listeners for focused testing

  **Benefits:**
  - **Better Code Organization**: Split large applications with many listeners into manageable, separate files
  - **Improved Maintainability**: Organize related listeners together (e.g., all DEX-specific listeners in one file)
  - **Focused Testing**: Evaluate specific listeners without noise from other listeners in your application

  **Migration:**
  - Existing single-file applications continue to work without changes
  - `Main.sol` must still exist and contain your `Triggers` contract
  - Listener contracts can be moved to separate files as needed

  This feature is particularly valuable for complex applications like DEX trade indexers that may have 15+ listeners and benefit from better file organization.
