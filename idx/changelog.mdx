<Update label="July 16, 2025" description="CLI Update">
  **Breaking Change: Generated Struct Names Now Include Contract Names**

  With the next CLI release, there will be a breaking change that impacts users who import and use generated structs from the ABI.

  **Why this change was needed:**
  The same struct name can be used across different contracts (example: `GPv2Trade.Data` and `GPv2Interaction.Data` within the same ABI) with different definitions. Using just the struct name for generated structs prevented proper hooking on protocols like CoW Swap.

  **What changed:**
  We now include the contract name as part of the struct name in the generated Solidity file associated with the ABI. Instead of using `$AbiName$StructName` for the names, we now use `$AbiName$ContractName$StructName`.

  **Impact:**
  If you have imported a generated struct, you'll need to update the name to include the contract name the next time you run codegen. This doesn't impact the default inputs/outputs/context structs, so most users won't encounter this issue.

  **Who is affected:**
  You'll only run into this issue if you:
  - Update to use the new CLI
  - Add a new ABI or manually run a new codegen
  - AND you've been using generated structs that aren't the ones provided in the trigger inputs/outputs object (i.e., you're using a nested struct from the inputs/outputs for some variable or part of the event)
</Update>
