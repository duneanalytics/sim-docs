# Summary

The data source component defines the chain and block range of an execution.

# Inputs

1. **Chain:** Choose a supported chain from the dropdown.
2. **Block range:** Choose a *From* and *To* block. 
   1. The *From* block can be any block between in \[1, tip block]. It is a closed limit, i.e., the *From* block is the first block executed. If left blank, the execution will start at the tip.
   2. *To* can be any block number greater than the *From* block or left empty. It is an open limit, i.e., the last block executed is the *To-1*.
   3. If it is greater than the current tip block, the associated execution will continue to run at the tip until the *To* block is reached.
   4. If *To* is empty, the execution will run indefinitely at the tip.

# Interactions

Using the three-dot menu, you can delete or duplicate a data source component.

# Allowed edges

## Outgoing

A data source component is used exclusively to define data for an execution, which is constructed as an edge between a data source and a EVM Lambda and/or Patch component.
