# Summary

The Schema component defines the shape of an object you want to emit from your EVM lambda: it dictates both the structure of your message (e.g., JSON fields), the Kafka topic/stream it is written to, and how the data will be typed in connected persistences and webhooks. You can create schemas directly or within the [EVM Lambda](https://docs.sim.io/docs/evm-lambda) component.

# Inputs

1. **Name:** The name of your schema. Must be unique per canvas.
2. **Fields:** Enter a name and select a Type corresponding to that field. 
   1. *Name*: A name for the field in the object. Must be unique per schema.
   2. *Type*: A Solidity data type, e.g., `bytes32` for a transaction hash or `address` for an address.
      1. Note that you can also define custom types--read more [here](https://docs.sim.io/docs/custom-types).

# Interactions

Once you've defined a schema, you can save it. Once saved, it can be reedited up until it is connected to a set persistence or used in an active execution, at which point it becomes read-only. When you edit a schema, it deletes all messages previously sent to the corresponding topic.

You can delete and duplicate schema components.

When you connect an EVM Lambda component to a schema, a function specific to that schema is automatically generated and added as an option in the left sidebar within the connected EVM Lambda component.

# Allowed edges

## Incoming

* EVM Lambda
* Patch

Code components can emit messages to a schema. A schema can be connected to more than one EVM Lambda and/or components. Similarly, each EVM Lambda or Patch may be connected to multiple schemas.

## Outgoing

* Persistence. Connect a persistence to your schema if you want to persist the messages in a database.
* Schema mirror. Connect a schema mirror to your schema if you want to ingest the schema's data into an external DB.
* Webhook. Connect a persistence to a webhook component if you want to trigger a Webhook for each message written to the schema.
