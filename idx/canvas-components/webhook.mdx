# Summary

The `Webhook` component creates a service that routes messages to your own server. Each message emitted from an `EVM Lambda` or `Patch` through a `Schema` you've connected to a `Webhook` instance will be routed to your server and delivered in realtime.

# Inputs

1. **Path:** The path to your server (must be `https` enabled).
2. **Secret**A string that will be used to verify the authenticity of messages received on your server. (must be a `base64` string prefixed by `whsec_`).
3. **Fields:** The list of fields from the `Schema` node connected to this `Webhook` node to propagate in the messages that will be sent to your server.

4. **Rate limit** The maximum number of messages that are allowed to be sent in 1 second to your server. Messages throttled by this limit will be queued and sent when possible.

# Interactions

Using the three-dot menu, you can delete or duplicate a `Webhook` component.

Using the toggle, a `Webhook` can be disabled/enabled.

Once set, you can send a test message to your server.

# Allowed edges

## Incoming

* `Schema`: a `Webhook` can have an incoming connection from a `Schema`. Once connected and active, each message of that `Schema` emitted from a `EVM Lambda` node will be routed through the `Webhook` to your server.

## Outgoing

* None
