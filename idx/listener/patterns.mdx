After learning about listeners in the [Listener Basics](/idx/listener) guide, you can use more advanced patterns to build sophisticated indexers.
This page explores core Sim IDX concepts that give you more flexibility in how you trigger listeners and structure your onchain data.

We will cover advanced triggering and calling other contracts via interfaces. For common listener compilation errors like name conflicts and `Stack too deep`, please see the [Listener Errors](/idx/listener/errors) guide.

## Trigger on an ABI

The `chainAbi` helper allows you to trigger your listener on any contract that matches a specific ABI signature. This is incredibly powerful for monitoring activity across all instances of a particular standard, like ERC-721 or Uniswap V3 pools, without needing to list every contract address explicitly.

<Note>
**ABI Matching is Permissive**: The matching behavior is permissive - if a contract implements the functions and events in the specified ABI, it counts as a match even if it also implements other functionality. This means contracts don't need to match the ABI exactly; they just need to include the required functions and events.
</Note>

The example below shows how to trigger the `onBurnEvent` handler for any contract on Ethereum that matches the `UniswapV3Pool` ABI. The `UniswapV3Pool$Abi()` is a helper struct that is automatically generated from that ABI file.

```solidity Main.sol
contract Triggers is BaseTriggers {
    function triggers() external virtual override {
        UniswapPoolListener listener = new UniswapPoolListener();
        // Trigger on any contract on Ethereum matching the UniswapV3Pool ABI
        addTrigger(chainAbi(Chains.Ethereum, UniswapV3Pool$Abi()), listener.triggerOnBurnEvent());
    }
}
```

```solidity Listener.sol
contract UniswapPoolListener is UniswapV3Pool$OnBurnEvent {
    event PoolBurn(address indexed poolAddress, address owner, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 amount);

    function onBurnEvent(EventContext memory ctx, UniswapV3Pool$BurnEventParams memory inputs) external override {
        // Only emit an event if the burn amount is greater than zero
        if (inputs.amount > 0) {
            emit PoolBurn(
                ctx.txn.call.callee, // The address of the pool that emitted the event
                inputs.owner,
                inputs.tickLower,
                inputs.tickUpper,
                inputs.amount
            );
        }
    }
}
```

## Trigger Globally

The `chainGlobal` helper creates triggers that are not tied to any specific contract or ABI. This can be used to set up block-level handlers with `onBlock` for tasks that need to run once per block, such as creating periodic data snapshots, calculating time-weighted averages, or performing end-of-block settlements.

The framework provides a built-in abstract contract, `Raw$OnBlock`, for this purpose. First, add it to your listener's inheritance list, then implement the `onBlock` handler and register the trigger.

```solidity Main.sol
contract Triggers is BaseTriggers {
    function triggers() external virtual override {
        MyBlockListener listener = new MyBlockListener();
        addTrigger(chainGlobal(Chains.Ethereum), listener.triggerOnBlock());
    }
}
```

```solidity MyBlockListener.sol
contract MyBlockListener is Raw$OnBlock {
    event BlockProcessed(uint256 blockNumber, uint256 timestamp);

    function onBlock(RawBlockContext memory /*ctx*/) external override {
        emit BlockProcessed(block.number, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```

The framework also provides abstract contracts for `Raw$OnCall` and `Raw$OnLog`, allowing you to create global triggers for every function call or every event log on a chain.

## Using Interfaces

Often, your handler is triggered by one contract, but you need to fetch additional data from another contract to enrich your event. For example, a `Swap` event on a pool tells you a swap occurred, but you need to call the pool contract directly to get its current `slot0` state. Solidity interfaces allow your listener to do this.

### 1. Define the Interface
It's best practice to create an `interfaces` directory (e.g., `listeners/src/interfaces/`) and define the interface in a new `.sol` file.

```solidity listeners/src/interfaces/IUniswapV3Pool.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

interface IUniswapV3Pool {
    function slot0()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint160 sqrtPriceX96,
            int24 tick,
            uint16 observationIndex,
            uint16 observationCardinality,
            uint16 observationCardinalityNext,
            uint8 feeProtocol,
            bool unlocked
        );
    // ... other functions
}
```

### 2. Import and Use the Interface
In your listener, import the interface. You can then cast a contract's address to the interface type to call its functions.

```solidity
import {IUniswapV3Pool} from "./interfaces/IUniswapV3Pool.sol";

contract Listener is UniswapV3Pool$OnSwapEvent {
    // ...
    function onSwapEvent(EventContext memory ctx, ...) external override {
        // Cast the address of the contract that triggered the event
        // to the IUniswapV3Pool interface to call its functions.
        (uint160 sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(ctx.txn.call.callee).slot0();
    }
}
```
