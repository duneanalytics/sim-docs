description: 'Learn about the Dune Analytics API and how it compares to Sim APIs, helping you choose the right tool for data analysis versus realtime applications.'
---

While Sim APIs provide low-latency, realtime data for building apps, Dune also offers a separate suite of analytical APIs.
Both are part of the Dune ecosystem, but they are designed for different use cases.

## When to Use Which API

Choosing the right API depends entirely on your goal.

### Use Sim APIs if...

Choose Sim APIs when you are building a user-facing application that needs fast data rendering and low-latency responses.
Sim APIs are ideal for realtime wallet balances, transaction history, and NFT collections through simple, ready-to-use REST endpoints so your app can react to onchain events quickly without writing SQL.

### Use the Dune Analytics API if...

Choose the [Dune Analytics API](https://docs.dune.com/api-reference/overview/introduction) when you need to answer complex, specific questions with custom SQL. 
It's best for analytical dashboards, reports, research, and integrating blockchain data into data warehouses or BI tools.
You can also export large historical datasets for offline analysis.

## Core Differences

| Aspect | Sim APIs | Dune Analytics API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data access & flexibility | REST endpoints for specific data types (e.g., balances, activity).<br />Data is pre-processed and optimized for immediate use in applications.<br /> | Execute any custom SQL query you have written on Dune.<br />Full flexibility to aggregate, join, and analyze data across Dune's entire dataset.<br />Access raw data directly through the Trino/Presto connector. |
| Performance & latency | Optimized for very low latency (p99 < 500ms).<br />Designed for real-time, interactive user experiences. | Built for complex analytical workloads.<br />Query execution times can range from seconds to minutes, depending on complexity. |
| Primary use cases | Wallets & portfolio trackers<br />Realtime activity feeds<br />DeFi dashboards & dApps<br />Onchain AI & autonomous agents | In-depth market research and analysis<br />Internal analytics dashboards<br />BI tool integration (Tableau, Metabase, etc.)<br />Programmatic export of large datasets (CSV) |

## What You Get with the Dune Analytics API

The [Dune Analytics API](https://docs.dune.com/api-reference/overview/introduction) offers a unique set of capabilities tailored for deep data analysis and custom queries. Here are some of the powerful features you can leverage that differ from Sim APIs.
