description: 'Learn about the Dune Analytics API and how it compares to Sim APIs, helping you choose the right tool for data analysis vs. realtime apps.'
---

While Sim APIs provide low-latency, realtime data for building apps, Dune also offers a separate suite of analytical APIs.
Both are part of the Dune ecosystem, but they are designed for different use cases.

## When to Use Which API

Use Sim APIs if you need low-latency app data (balances, activity, NFTs) via simple REST endpoints so your UI can react to onchain events without writing SQL.

Use the [Dune Analytics API](https://docs.dune.com/api-reference/overview/introduction) if you need custom SQL for analysis, dashboards, BI/warehousing, or exporting large historical datasets.

## Core Differences

| Aspect | Sim APIs | Dune Analytics API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data access & flexibility | Ready-made realtime REST endpoints optimized for apps. | Run custom SQL across Dune’s dataset.<br />Connect with the DuneSQL Trino connector. |
| Performance & latency | Very low latency for realtime experiences. | Built for analytical workloads.<br />Queries may take seconds to minutes. |
| Primary use cases | Wallets, activity feeds, DeFi dashboards, onchain agents. | Market research and internal dashboards.<br />BI integration such as PowerBI and Metabase, plus CSV exports. |

## What You Get with the Dune Analytics API

The [Dune Analytics API](https://docs.dune.com/api-reference/overview/introduction) offers a unique set of capabilities tailored for deep data analysis and custom queries. Here are some of the powerful features you can leverage that differ from Sim APIs.
